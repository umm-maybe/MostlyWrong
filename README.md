# MostlyWrong 

## What this is

A set of summaries of blog posts by Eliezer Yudkowsky, generated by [a machine learning algorithm.](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-cnn)

## Why it exists

EY's blog [LessWrong](https://lesswrong.com) has become a popular forum for people in the "AI Alignment" community.  There is an [Alignment Forum](https://www.alignmentforum.org/about) site which is "integrated" with LessWrong. You can log in there with your LessWrong username--except you can't post unless you have proven yourself worthy to be invited.

Presumably, you could get invited to the Alignment Forum by posting or commenting on LessWrong. But wait! On the front page of LessWrong you may see a notification urging you to read at least 50 of Elezier's blog posts (7 hours of reading) plus "Rationality A-Z", a collection of the blog posts he wrote daily for two years, before posting or commenting. 

Haven't got time for that? Me neither! This "Cliff's Notes" version is for you. Skim it, and then go ask find some longtermists to pester!

## How I did it

1. Download [the aforementioned blog posts in epub format](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZYtwnKwXmEAWhm8dT/an-epub-of-eliezer-s-blog-posts)
2. Convert them to txt [using Zamzar](https://www.zamzar.com/convert/epub-to-txt/)
3. Create a python virtual environment, activate it, and run `pip3 install transformers spacy`
4. Then run `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`
5. Then run *summarize_corpus.py*

## Caveats

There may be (in fact likely are) some misrepresentations and misattributions in the text. If anyone familiar with Yudkowsky's writing wishes to do so, they are welcome to raise issues and/or directly edit and submit pull requests to make changes to the markdown file. In other words, the version stored in this repo doesn't need to remain a pure representation of the BART seq2seq output; it can operate like a wiki document.
