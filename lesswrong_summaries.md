## The Martial Art of Rationality
Rationality is the 'martial art of mind' - but it's not about training muscles, it's about training brain machinery we have in common. Human species has acquired a great deal of new knowledge about human rationality in the last few decades. Humanity may finally be ready to synthesize the martial art of rationality to refine, share, systematize and pass on techniques of personal rationality.
## Why truth? And...
Philosopher: "The first virtue is curiosity" He says that if your motive is curiosity, you will assign priority to questions according to how the questions tickle your personal aesthetic sense. He says curiosity is an emotion and is therefore "not rational"
## ...What's a bias, again?
A bias is an obstacle to our goal of obtaining truth, but there are many obstacles that are not "biases" The truth is a narrow target, a small region of configuration space to hit. Error is not an exceptional condition; it is success which is a priori so improbable that it requires explanation.
## The Proper Use of Humility
Scientist says good science requires some kind of humility. He says a creationist's selective underconfidence is the wrong step in the dance. Scientists themselves ought to be more humble, and compromise, he says.
## The Modesty Argument
The Modesty Argument states that when two or more human beings disagree about a question of simple fact, they should each adjust their probability estimates in the direction of the others' The argument is inspired by Aumann's Agreement Theorem.
## "I don't know."
An edited transcript of a long instant-messenger conversation that took place regarding the phrase, "I don't know" It was sparked by Robin Hanson's previous post, "You Are Never Entitled to Your Opinion"
## A Fable of Science and Politics
In the time of the Roman Empire, civic life was divided between the Blue and Green factions. The Blues and the Greens murdered each other in single combats, in ambushes, in group battles, in riots. The conflict has not vanished. Society is still divided along "Blue" and "Green" lines, and there is a " blue" and a "green" position on almost every contemporary issue.
## Some Claims Are Just Too Extraordinary
A peer-reviewed, journal-published, replicated report is worth far more than what you see with your own eyes. People can fool themselves, hallucinate, and even go insane. The controls on publication in major journals are more trustworthy than the very fabric of your brain.
## Outside the Laboratory
"Outside the laboratory, scientists are no wiser than anyone else" The proverb is said by scientists to remind themselves of their fallibility. It is a ritualized tradition for testing hypotheses experimentally. To gain new information about the territory, you have to interact with the territory.
## Politics is the Mind-Killer
This is my personal opinion, not a statement of official Overcoming Bias policy. If you want to make a point about science, or rationality, then my advice is to not choose a domain from contemporary politics if you can possibly avoid it. Politics is an important domain to which we should individually apply our rationality.
## Just Lose Hope Already
Casey Serin, a 24-year-old web programmer with no prior experience in real estate, owes banks 2.2 million dollars after lying on mortgage applications. He took cash out of the mortgage (applied for larger amounts than the price of the house) and spent the money on living expenses.
## You Are Not Hiring the Top 1%
Every employer thinks they're getting the top 0.5% when they're actually getting theTop 99.9801%. This might explain some other phenomena I've heard of, such as the "slush heap" of inconceivably awful stories received in the mail.
## Policy Debates Should Not Appear One-Sided
Robin Hanson proposed stores where banned products could be sold. Why did some people think it was an argument in favor of regulation? Because they want policy debates to be one-sided.
## Burch's Law
Greg Burch: If people have a right to be stupid, the market will respond. He was speaking about sport-utility vehicles, which he feels are very poorly designed. Burch did not even advocate regulating SUVs.
## The Scales of Justice, the Notebook of Rationality
Lady Justice is widely depicted as carrying a scales. This makes things convenient and easy to track, but is usually a gross distortion. In the real world, facts may be cited by different sides of the same debate, but they are logically distinct.
## Blue or Green on Regulation?
Sebastian Thrun: There are two and only two sides to the issue - pro-regulation and anti-regulation. All arguments are either allied soldiers or enemy soldiers; they fight on one side or the other. He says the FDA prevents 5,000 casualties per year but causes at least 20,000-120,000 by delaying approval.
## Superstimuli and the Collapse of Western Civilization
At least three people have died playing online games for days without rest. People have lost their spouses, jobs, and children to World of Warcraft. If people have the right to play video games, then the market is going to respond by supplying the most engaging video games.
## Useless Medical Disclaimers
A doctor's disclaimer form for minor surgery included a risk of infection, repeat surgery, chronic pain, amputation, spontaneous combustion, meteor strikes, and a plague of locusts o'er the land. The form had no statistical information, making it useless for making decisions, says writer. "You can't translate something into an expected utility, even a qualitative and approximate one, if it doesn't come with a probability attached," he says.
## Archimedes's Chronophone
Think of how many generations of humanity would have benefited if certain ideas had been invented sooner, rather than later. If the Greeks had invented science, if the Romans had possessed printing presses. If Western civilization had turned against slavery in the thirteenth century, it would have done a lot of good.
## Chronophone Motivations
The Chronophone: How to send messages back in time to Archimedes of Syracuse. The challenge was to say something useful under the restriction that Archimede's cognitive strategies would not be transmitted. A surprising number of respondents seemed to completely miss the point of the chronophone.
## Self-deception: Hypocrisy or Akrasia?
A hypocrite is someone who says a morality which they do not, themselves, believe, writes Will Wilkinson. Wilkinson says that in the traditional sense of the term, we don't always live up to the goals we set for ourselves. Even if I tell all my friends that they ought to exercise 3 times per week, that doesn't necessarily make me a hypocrite, he says.
## Tsuyoku Naritai! (I Want To Become Stronger)
In Orthodox Judaism there is a saying: "The previous generation is to the next one as angels are to men"
## Tsuyoku vs. the Egalitarian Instinct
If you can't admit to yourself that you've done better than others, then the median will forever be your concrete wall, the place where you stop moving forward. Maybe it's not healthy to pride yourself on doing better than someone else. But surely it isn't healthy to be ashamed of doing better.
## "Statistical Bias"
Statistical bias is error you cannot correct by repeating the experiment many times and averaging together the results. The law of large numbers says that you can reduce variance, not bias, by averaging the results of experiments.
## Useful Statistical Biases
All else being equal, bias is bad - you want to get rid of it. But all else is not always equal. Sometimes, by accepting a small amount of bias in your estimator, you can eliminate a large amount of variance. This is known as the bias-variance tradeoff.
## The Error of Crowds
Bias-variance decomposition is not about modesty, communication, sharing of evidence, tolerating different opinions, humbling yourself, overconfidence, or group compromise.
## The Majority Is Always Wrong
Frequentism, the predominant view in mainstream statistics, is the worst of the three major alternatives. You can survive by being popular, or by being superior, but alternatives that are neither popular nor superior quickly go extinct. Dvorak seems to be much easier on the fingers than Qwerty.
## Knowing About Biases Can Hurt People
Cognitive psychology professor: 'People with high g-factor end up being less effective because they are too sophisticated as arguers' 'I've seen people severely messed up by their own knowledge of biases,' he says.
## Debiasing as Non-Self-Destruction
How to be smart varies widely between professions, says Nick Bostrom. Successful debiasing is the art of non-self-destruction, he says. Most people who take a halfhearted potshot at debiases themselves do not get much mileage out of it.
## "Inductive Bias"
Machine learning algorithm can make inductive and inductive biases. inductive bias concentrates probability into sequences that don't occur. The more inductive evidence you have, the faster you learn to predict the future. Inductive bias can be probabilistically correct or incorrect.
## Suggested Posts
If you have a suggested Overcoming Bias topic you'd like to see discussed, post it in a comment here. But please don't actually discuss the topic with further comments, just give us the suggestion. This post is for topic suggestions, not topic discussions.
## Futuristic Predictions as Consumable Goods
Futurists make the same mistaken predictions over and over. Predictions, like promises, are sold today and consumed today. They produce a few chewy bites of delicious optimism or delicious horror.
## Marginally Zero-Sum Efforts
The problem is that there is a marginal return to each person for their efforts. If there are 20 grant proposals, only one will be funded, so everyone else must write another. This creates a vicious cycle.
## Priors as Mathematical Objects
In the scriptures of Deep Bayesianism, such as Probability Theory: The Logic of Science, one finds a different concept - that of prior information. Our belief about the population frequency of breast cancer is only one small element of our prior information, as a mathematical object.
## Lotteries: A Waste of Hope
Some have tried to defend lottery-ticket buying as a rational purchase of fantasy. But the fantasy is of wealth that arrives without effort - without conscientiousness, learning, charisma, or even patience. The human brain doesn't do 64-bit floating-point arithmetic, and it can't devalue the emotional force of a pleasant anticipation.
## New Improved Lottery
The New Improved Lottery pays out every five years on average, at a random time. You buy in once, for a single dollar, and get not just a few days of epsilon chance of becoming rich. Not only that, your wealth could strike at any time! At any minute, the phone could ring to inform you that you are a millionaire!
## Your Rationality is My Business
I believe that it is right and proper for me, as a human being, to have an interest in the future. One of those interests is the human pursuit of truth, which has strengthened slowly over the generations. I wish to strengthen that pursuit further, in this generation, for the Future. For we are all of us players upon that vast gameboard, whether we accept the responsibility or not.
## Consolidated Nature of Morality Thread
This post will distinguish between moral judgments and factual beliefs. I suggest consolidating the debate on the nature of morality to avoid it taking over other posts. We experience some of our morals and preferences as voluntary choices, others as involuntary perceptions.
## Feeling Rational
Rationality begins by asking how-the-world-is, but spreads virally to any other thought which depends on how we think the world is. If you believe that there is a goblin in your closet that ties your shoe's laces together, then this is a belief about how- the- world-is. If there's something out there which can reach out and tie your shoelaces, it must be real too. If so, as you study the skills of rationality and train yourself not to deny facts, your feelings will become stronger.
## Universal Fire
Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier discovered fire in the late eighteenth century. Fire was still held to be basic - in the form of "phlogiston" Phosphorus is highly reactive; pure pure phosphorus glows in the dark.
## Universal Law
The only time when it seems like we would want a law to hold everywhere is when we are talking about moral laws - tribal rules of behavior. The idea of a rule with literally no exceptions seems insanely rigid, the product of closed-minded thinking by fanatics. As far as we know, there has been not one single violation of conservation of momentum.
## Think Like Reality
Reality has been around since long before you showed up. A good model makes reality look normal, not weird. Intuition is only a model by another name.
## Beware the Unsurprised
In Think Like Reality, I put forth the proposition that when human intuitions disagree with a fact, we need to either disprove the "fact" in question, or try to reshape the intuition. Probability theory says that a model which is consistently surprised on the data is probably not a very good model. In practice, we may want to be wary of people who don't appear surprised by surprising-seeming data.
## The Third Alternative
Claims that a Noble Lie is a net benefit should be preserved for utilitarian reasons. False dilemmas often presented to justify unethical policies. Lying, for example, is often much more convenient than telling the truth.
## Third Alternatives for Afterlife-ism
One of the most commonly proposed Noble Lies is belief in an afterlife. The assumed task is to find a source of hope against looming death. One way is to cite medical nanotechnology, actuarial escape velocity, cryonics, or meddling with the forbidden ultimate technology.
## Scope Insensitivity
A study found that people are insensitive to scope when it comes to altruistic action. People spend enough money to create a warm glow in themselves, a sense of having done their duty. People visualize "a single exhausted bird, its feathers soaked in black oil, unable to escape" This image, or prototype, calls forth some level of emotional arousal.
## One Life Against the World
"Whoever saves a single life, it is as if he had saved the whole world."-- The Talmud, Sanhedrin 4:5. "When human lives are at stake, we have a duty to maximize, not satisfice"
## Risk-Free Bonds Aren't
US bonds have not defaulted within their trading experience, people assume this is impossible. Citing the good track record of the US alone is purest survivorship bias. The safest instruments on this planet aren't very safe.
## Correspondence Bias
We tend to see far too direct a correspondence between others' actions and personalities. When we see someone else kick a vending machine for no visible reason, we assume they are "an angry person" But when you yourself kick the vending machine, it's because the bus was late, the train was early, your report is overdue, and now the damned vending machine has eaten your lunch money for the second day in a row.
## Are Your Enemies Innately Evil?
When someone offends us, the correspondence bias redoubles. We see unusual dispositions that exactly match the unusual behavior, rather than asking after real situations or imagined situations that could explain the behavior. Most people don't construct their life stories with themselves as the villains. The Enemy's story, as seen by the Enemy, is not going to make the Enemy look bad.
## Open Thread
By request of the community, an Open Thread for free-form comments, so long as they're still related to the basic project of this blog. A word on post requests: You're free to ask, but the authors can't commit to posting on requested topics.
## Two More Things to Unlearn from School
In Three Things to Unlearn from School, author Bill Bullard lists three bad habits of thought. One is attaching importance to personal opinions, solving given problems, and earning approval of others. Another is that even if you don't really understand something, you should parrot it back anyway, he says.
## Making Beliefs Pay Rent (in Anticipated Experiences)
Homo sapiens can learn to model the unseen, but it is also one of our great weak points. Humans often believe in things that are not only unseen but unreal. To anticipate sensory experiences as precisely as possible, we must process beliefs that aren't anticipations.
## Belief in Belief
Carl Sagan once told a parable of a man who claims: "There is a dragon in my garage"
## Bayesian Judo
Aumann's Agreement Theorem says that no two rationalists can agree to disagree. If two people disagree, one of them must be doing something wrong.
## Professing and Cheering
A pagan woman on a science panel held forth on the creation of the Earth. She said she believed that a primordial cow was born into the primordial abyss. She was not trying to convince the audience, she was flaunting her belief. She didn't even try to convince herself that she took her religion seriously.
## Belief as Attire
Belief as attire is the idea of wearing a group uniform. It's like dressing up as a Nazi for Halloween. Believing with a tribe is a very strong emotional force.
## Religion's Claim to be Non-Disprovable
Bible contains stories of events that would constitute unmistakable evidence if they'd actually happened. The New Testament doesn't claim big-scale miracles as the Old Testament did. Instead it claims smaller miracles which fit into the same framework of evidence.
## The Importance of Saying "Oops"
The author was raised on equal parts science and science fiction. He writes that he was raised in Traditional Rationality, but switched to Bayescraft after a big mistake. He says he realized that Traditional Rationalist tactics were not enough to prevent him from making a large mistake.
## Focus Your Uncertainty
Pundit: No matter which of the three possibilities comes true, you'll be able to explain why the outcome perfectly fits your pet market theory. No one can possibly foresee the future, so how are you to use "probabilities" to prepare excuses?
## The Proper Use of Doubt
Jesuits tell their novices to doubt Christianity, God, and other issues. The conduct sounds to me like a program of desensitization for something very scary. But even so, they are encouraging their novelettes to doubt - right? Does it matter if their reasons are flawed? Is this not a worthy deed unto a rationalist?
## The Virtue of Narrowness
What is true of one apple may not be true of another apple; thus more can be said about a single apple than about all the apples in the world. It is a necessary part of the rationalist's art - or even the poet's art! - to focus narrowly on unusual pebbles which possess some special quality. The knowledge in-depth study is useless if it is not used to understand things in detail.
## You Can Face Reality
Eugene Gendlin: What is true is already so. Gendlins: People can stand what is true, because they are already enduring it. The truth is that it's what is there to be interacted with.
## The Apocalypse Bet
Bets on future events are likely to disrupt settlement of trades. We can have a prediction market on a generic apocalypse. Participants who believe in an earlier apocalypse are paid by believers in a later apocalypse.
## Your Strength as a Rationalist
A rationalist's strength as a rationalist is your ability to be more confused by fiction than by reality. A hypothesis that forbids nothing, permits everything, fails to constrain anticipation.
## I Defy the Data!
If an experiment contradicts the dominant theory, we should throw out the theory instead of the experiment. But Science has this notion that you can never go against an honestly obtained experimental result.
## Absence of Evidence Is Evidence of Absence
Post-hoc fitting of evidence to hypothesis was involved in internment of Japanese-Americans. Lack of sabotage doesn't prove that no Fifth Column exists. Absence of proof is not proof of absence. If you don't notice when your model makes evidence unlikely, you might as well have no model.
## Conservation of Expected Evidence
Followup to: Absence of Evidence Is Evidence of Absence.
## Update Yourself Incrementally
For every expectation of evidence, there is an equal and opposite expectation of counterevidence. A probabilistic model can take a hit or two, and still survive, so long as the hits don't keep on coming in. People want their debates to be one-sided; they are accustomed to a world in which their preferred theories have not one iota of antisupport. The work of rationality is done within you, whether well or poorly. If choosing the wrong side is viscerally terrifying, even just a little visceral terrifying, you'd best integrate all the evidence.
## One Argument Against An Army
The author advises people not to downshift their confidence when faced with contrary evidence. He says people should rehearse already-known support to avoid downshifting their confidence. He argues that by rehearsing arguments you already knew, you are double-counting evidence.
## Hindsight bias
Hindsight bias is when people who know the answer vastly overestimate its predictability or obviousness. Hindsight bias matters in legal cases, where a judge or jury must determine whether a defendant was legally negligent in failing to foresee a hazard.
## Hindsight Devalues Science
Meyers: Social scientists often find that people's behavior is "pretty much what you'd expect" He says that the "expectation" is all hindsight. We need to make a conscious effort to be shocked enough.
## Scientific Evidence, Legal Evidence, Rational Evidence
Rationalist writes that historical knowledge is not scientific knowledge. "The Sun will rise on September 18th, 2007" is a scientific belief.
## Is Molecular Nanotechnology "Scientific"?
Nanotech is pseudoscience because no one has ever seen a nanofactory, so how can believing in their possibility be scientific? Drexler would reply that his extrapolations of diamondoid nanomachines are based on standard physics, which is to say, scientific generalizations.
## Fake Explanations
In physics, the substance of a model is the control it exerts on anticipation. "Because of heat conduction" is a disguised hypothesis of maximum entropy. It is anticipation-isomorphic to saying "magic" It feels like an explanation, but it's not.
## Guessing the Teacher's Password
When I was young, I knew that light was waves, sound was waves and matter was waves. I took pride in my scientific literacy, when I was nine years old. But in school, the teacher hands you a gold star for saying "made of waves", which must be the correct answer because the teacher heard a physicist emit the same sound.
## Science as Attire
Scientists who believe in evolution use the phrase "because of evolution" because they want to be part of the scientific in-crowd, says author. The X-Men comics use terms like "evolution", "mutation", and "genetic code" purely to place themselves in the literary genre of science.
## Fake Causality
Phlogiston was the 18 century's answer to the Elemental Fire of the Greek alchemists. Phlogiston escaped from burning substances as visible fire.
## Semantic Stopsigns
"Where did God come from?" is a question many people ask themselves when they consider the paradox of the First Cause. 'God!' is a way of belonging to a tribe, which gives people a motive to say it as often as possible. "Democracy!" is more precise: it's a semantic stopsign as a question-and-answer chain.
## Mysterious Answers to Mysterious Questions
Vitalists saw a mysterious gap in their knowledge, and postulated a mysterious stuff that plugged the gap. If I am ignorant about a phenomenon, that is a fact about my own state of mind, not a fact of the phenomenon itself.
## The Futility of Emergence
"Emergence" is commonly used as an explanation in its own right. Emergence is popular because it is such a wonderfully easy explanation, and it gives you a sacred mystery to worship. It's the noun "emergence" that I protest, rather than the verb "emerges from". "Arises from" is another legitimate phrase that means exactly the same thing.
## Positive Bias: Look Into the Dark
Researchers have found that most people are biased toward positive examples. A common mistake is to try to test positive examples rather than negative ones.
## Say Not "Complexity"
Complexity should never be a goal in itself, says professor of AI. In AI theory you must linger at the mystery to confront it directly. There are many words that can skip over mysteries, and some of them would be legitimate in other contexts.
## My Wild and Reckless Youth
Traditional Rationality taught as an art, rather than a science, as physicists describe the life of famous physicists.
## Failing to Learn from History
The author tried to explain a Mysterious Phenomenon. He was trying to provide a cause for it, fitting it into an integrated model of reality. He later realized that he was solving a mystery should make it feel less confusing. When science dares to challenge a new Great Puzzle, children are skeptical, he says.
## Making History Available
There is an inverse error to generalizing from fictional evidence: failing to be sufficiently moved by historical evidence. Many biases involve being insufficiently moved by dry, abstract information. For example, why should I remember the Wright Brothers' first flight? I was not there.
## Stranger Than History
In the future, the sky will be filled by billions of floating black spheres. Each sphere will be larger than all the zeppelins that have ever existed put together. If you offer a sphere money, it will lower a male prostitute out of the sky on a bungee cord.
## Explain/Worship/Ignore?
When it rains, and you don't know why, you have several options. Each time you hit Explain, science grinds for a while, returns an explanation. As good rationalists, we feel duty-bound to keep hitting Explain, but it seems like a road that has no end. So, if we continue long enough, we must come to a special dialog box, a new option, an Explanation That Needs No Explanation, a place where the chain ends.
## "Science" as Curiosity-Stopper
Econblog: Why should your curiosity be diminished because someone else, not you, knows how the light bulb works? Econ Blog: It's not enough for you to know; other people must also be ignorant, or you won't be happy.
## Absurdity Heuristic, Absurdity Bias
The less X resembles Y, or the more X violates Y, the less probable that X is the product, explanation, or outcome of Y. A sequence of events is less probable when it involves an egg unscrambling itself, water flowing upward, machines thinking or dead people coming back to life.
## Availability
The availability heuristic is judging the frequency or probability of an event, by the ease with which examples of the event come to mind. The objective frequency of Bill Gates is 0.00000000015, but you hear about him much more often. The probability of a suicide is twice as frequent as a murder because murders are more vivid (hence also more remembered). But either way, an availability bias is at work.
## Why is the Future So Absurd?
Followup to: Stranger than History, Absurdity Heuristic / Absurdicity Bias. People seem to imagine futures that are counterintuitive with one or two interesting changes.
## Anchoring and Adjustment
Tversky and Kahneman (1974) recorded the estimates of subjects who saw the Wheel of Fortune showing various numbers. They found that subjects took the initial, uninformative number as their starting point.
## The Crackpot Offer
When he was young he thought he had found a disproof of Cantor's Diagonal Argument, a famous theorem which demonstrates that the real numbers outnumber the rational numbers. But after finding a counterexample he realized he had made a mistake and that his dreams of fame and glory had been dashed. He decided to let go of the idea and move on with his life.
## Radical Honesty
Cecile Richards: Truth is more important than lying to others. She says it's better to be honest than to lie.
## We Don't Really Want Your Participation
At Singularity Summit, speakers said we should "reach out" to artists to participate in dialogue. He wanted to leap up and say: No, no, I'm afraid you've misunderstood. We don't actually want to hear from artists.
## Applause Lights
Conceptually, the word "democracy" is an applause light that tells an audience when to clap. The phrase can be translated as "we need to balance the risks and opportunities of AI" This can be used to introduce a discussion topic, or as a point of view.
## Rationality and the English Language
Writer says he was reminded of George Orwell's Politics and the English Language by a reader. Orwell's work is mandatory reading for rationalists as well as authors, he says. He says writers should avoid using the passive voice in journal articles and novels.
## Human Evil and Muddled Thinking
George Orwell saw the descent of the civilized world into totalitarianism. He put forth a convulsive effort to wrench it off its path. Orwell's weapon was clear writing. He knew that human evil and muddled thinking intertwine.
## Doublethink (Choosing to be Biased)
An oblong slip of newspaper had appeared between O'Brien's fingers. For perhaps five seconds it was within the angle of Winston's vision. It was a photograph, and there was no question of its identity. Winston made a desperate, agonizing effort to wrench the top half of his body free.
## Why I'm Blooking
A blook is a collection of blog posts that have been edited into a book. In August, Overcoming Bias blogger wrote one blog post per day for Over overcoming Bias. A new challenge forced him to stop blogging and prepare two talks for the Singularity Summit.
## Planning Fallacy
Denver International Airport opened 16 months late, at a cost overrun of $2 billion. Eurofighter Typhoon, a joint defense project of several European countries, was delivered 54 months late. The Sydney Opera House may be the most legendary construction overrun of all time.
## Kahneman's Planning Anecdote
Followup to: Planning Fallacy. From "Timid Choices and Bold Forecasts: Cognitive Perspective on Risk Taking"
## Conjunction Fallacy
The following experiment has been slightly modified for ease of blogging. The six propositions may or may not be true, and are not mutually exclusive or exhaustive. 92% of 94 undergraduates at the University of British Columbia gave an ordering with A > E > C.
## Conjunction Controversy (Or, How They Nail It Down)
People often try to dismiss (not defy) the experimental data. It's not impossible for researchers to make mistakes. We're all only human here.
## Burdensome Details
Conjunction fallacy occurs when humans rate the probability P(A&B) higher than P(B) This is because we "substitute judgment of representativeness for judgment of probability" The implausibility of one claim is compensated by the plausibility of the other; they "average out"
## What is Evidence?
Rational thought produces beliefs which are themselves evidence. Entanglement can be contagious when processed correctly, which is why you need eyes and a brain.
## The Lens That Sees Its Flaws
Mice can see, but they can't understand seeing. Human brains can understand seeing, and because of that, you can do things which mice cannot do. Science is, simply, reflective reasoning about a more reliable process for making the contents of your mind mirror the world.
## How Much Evidence Does It Take?
How much entanglement is required to support a belief? How much evidence is needed to win the lottery?
## Einstein's Arrogance
In 1919, Sir Arthur Eddington led expeditions to Brazil and to the island of Principe, aiming to observe solar eclipses and thereby test an experimental prediction of Einstein's novel theory of General Relativity. A journalist asked Einstein what he would do if the observations failed to match his theory. Einstein famously replied: "Then I would feel sorry for the good Lord. The theory is correct."
## Occam's Razor
The more complex an explanation is, the more evidence you need just to find it in belief-space. Occam's Razor is often phrased as "The simplest explanation that fits the facts"
## 9/26 is Petrov Day
September 26th is Petrov Day. Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Yevgrafovich Petrov was the officer on duty when the warning system reported a US missile launch. Petrov decided that, all else being equal, he would prefer not to destroy the world.
## How to Convince Me That 2 + 2 = 3
Cihan Baran: My belief in 2+2=4 is unconditional. I cannot conceive of a situation that would make 2 + 2 = 4 false.
## The Bottom Line
There are all manner of signs and portents indicating whether a box contains a diamond, says philosopher. The true import of a thing is its entanglement with other things, he says.
## What Evidence Filtered Evidence?
A Bayesian must always condition on all known evidence, on pain of paradox. But then the clever arguer can make you believe anything he chooses, if there is a sufficient variety of signs to selectively report.
## Rationalization
"Rationality" is the forward flow that gathers evidence, weighs it, and outputs a conclusion. "Rationalization" is a backward flow from conclusion to selected evidence. "Anti-rationality" operates to fix beliefs in place; it would be better named "anti-rationalities"
## Recommended Rationalist Reading
Bayes' methods in decision making. Can you recommend any good books on the subject?
## A Rational Argument
Campaign manager can't make an argument for a candidate using all the evidence at hand. He suggests a list of questions to be asked of candidates. Then, he says, make a rational chain of argument flowing forward from the lines above it.
## We Change Our Minds Less Often Than We Think
Dale Griffin: We change our minds less often than we think. We become able to guess what our answer will be within half a second of hearing the question. Once your belief is fixed, no amount of argument will alter the truth-value. Once an idea gets into your head, it probably will stay there.
## Avoiding Your Belief's Real Weak Points
In Modern Orthodox Judaism, you're allowed to doubt, but not to successfully doubt. Orthodox Jews are, by large, more civilized than the Old Testament editors. Even the old rabbis were sufficiently kind to the Plagues that they saw the weakerness of Science.
## The Meditation on Curiosity
"It is my duty to criticize my own beliefs," says philosopher. Criticizing yourself from a sense of duty leaves you wanting to have investigated, he writes. "A burning itch to know is higher than a solemn vow to pursue truth," he says.
## Singlethink
The author's journey to rationality began when he realized he had always known that he was wrong. He found out about the Prisoner's Dilemma pretty early in life, but not at the age of seven. He discovered that the terrifying depths of the confirmation bias go on and on.
## No One Can Exempt You From Rationality's Laws
Traditional Rationality is phrased in terms of social rules, with violations interpretable as cheating. If you want me to accept a belief from you, you are obligated to provide me with a certain amount of evidence. Theory is obligated to expose itself to falsification - if it tries to duck out, that's like trying to duck in to initiation ritual.
## A Priori
Bayesians believe that the brain is an engine of accuracy, and if you violate the laws of rationality, the engine doesn't run. Bayes: If the brain has an amazing "a priori truth factory" that works to produce accurate beliefs, it makes you wonder why a thirsty hunter-gatherer can't use the "a. priori" to locate drinkable water.
## Priming and Contamination
Priming is subconscious and unstoppable, an artifact of the human neural architecture. Trying to stop yourself from priming is like trying to stop the spreading activation of your own neural circuits. Priming also reveals the massive parallelism of spreading activation.
## Do We Believe Everything We're Told?
Daniel Gilbert saw a crazy pattern emerging: Do we believe everything we're told? He found that distracting subjects should interfere with accepting true statements and rejecting false statements.
## Cached Thoughts
If you did need to write realtime programs for a hundred billion 100Hz processors, one trick you'd use as heavily as possible is caching. The brain completes the pattern automatically - and if you don't consciously realize the pattern needs correction, you'll be left with a completed pattern. In modern civilization particularly, no one can think fast enough to think their own thoughts.
## The "Outside the Box" Box
Everyone outside the field knows that neural networks are the Dominant-Paradigm-Overthrowing New Idea. The problem with originality is that you actually have to think in order to attain it, instead of letting your brain complete the pattern. "Originality" in this sense is inherently social, because it can only be determined by comparison to other people.
## Original Seeing
Prisig: For every fact there is an infinity of hypotheses. The more you look the more you see.
## How to Seem (and Be) Deep
In a Silicon Valley discussion group, people talked about the meaning that death gives to life, and how death is truly a blessing in disguise. The topic brought out deep emotions, and several people came up to say they thought the transhumanist was "deep" This got him thinking about what makes people seem deep, and what makes them seem hollow.
## The Logical Fallacy of Generalization from Fictional Evidence
Science fiction is not a full-fledged rational attempt to forecast the future. The requirements of storytelling are not the same as the requirements of forecasting. A story is never a rational attempt at analysis, not even with the most diligent science fiction writers. The greatest difficulty is not verifying the correct answer but simply locating it in answer space.
## Hold Off On Proposing Solutions
Norman R. F. Maier: Don't propose solutions until the problem has been discussed thoroughly. His advice echoes the principle that effectiveness of our decisions is determined by what we did first.
## "Can't Say No" Spending
The net effect of Western aid to Africa is actively destructive. Aid is a chaotic flux of money and goods that destroys local industry.
## Congratulations to Paris Hilton
Paris Hilton has signed up for cryonics. She will be kept alive by the Cryonics Institute. Her decision is a mistake, but she's got the right to do it.
## Pascal's Mugging: Tiny Probabilities of Vast Utilities
Pascal's Wager: A compactly specified wager can grow in size much faster than it grows in complexity. The utility of a Turing machine can grow faster than its prior probability shrinks. An AI is not given its code, and if it assesses the reason for reasonableness, it is not correct.
## Illusion of Transparency: Why No One Understands You
People who know the outcome of a situation believe the outcome should have been easy to predict in advance. Even when warned, we can't de-interpret to empathize with someone who doesn't know what we know.
## Self-Anchoring
An AI might be able to create a distinct, simulated visual cortex to imagine what a human "sees" We humans only have one visual cortex, and if we want to imagine What someone else is seeing, we've got to simulate it using our own visual cortex. We can't stop ourselves from leaking over.
## Expecting Short Inferential Distances
In an ancestral environment, you almost never have to explain your concepts. All background knowledge is universal knowledge. An evolutionary-psychological argument for a new theory will underestimate distances. The audience will just think you're condescending.
## Explainers Shoot High. Aim Low!
A few years ago, Ralph Merkle wrote an explanation of probability. He thought it would be more accessible to people outside of his field. He was wrong. He writes: "It's assumed that the reader knows what a "probability" is"
## Double Illusion of Transparency
In 2002, Bayes For Everyone wrote An Intuitive Explanation of Bayesian Reasoning, still one of his most popular works. He wrote it to explain how words, like all other useful forms of thought, are secretly a disguised form of Bayes inference. His listeners didn't get it, and he had to go back and explain it again and again. He realised he was falling prey to a double illusion of transparency.
## No One Knows What Science Doesn't Know
In the ancestral environment it was possible to know everything, and nearly everyone did. No one knows what 6 billion people don't know today, and less does anyone still know what 7 billion people will know tomorrow.
## Why Are Individual IQ Differences OK?
Idang Alibi of Abuja, Nigeria writes on the James Watson affair.
## Bay Area Bayesians Unite!
Would you be interested in a Bay Area meetup of Overcoming Bias readers? Vote in at least the closest-city poll. If I get at least 30 responses, I'll look into meetup locations.
## Motivated Stopping and Motivated Continuation
In real life, you have to generate your options, and they studied how subjects did that. Evidence is often costly, and worse, slow, and there is nothing virtuous about refusing to integrate the evidence you already have.
## Torture vs. Dust Specks
"What's the worst that can happen?" is probably a bad question to ask anyone with a creative imagination. "This is one of the worse things that can realistically happen to one person in today's world" "I think the answer is obvious"
## A Case Study of Motivated Continuation
If you actually answer the dilemma, then no matter which option you choose, you're giving something up. Refusing to choose is like refusing to allow time to pass. If there's missing information, fill in the blanks with plausible assumptions.
## A Terrifying Halloween Costume
After the jump, you can see me dressed up as something so horrifyingly dreadful that it surpasses the comprehension of a mortal human mind.
## Fake Justification
Many Christians who've stopped really believing now insist that they revere the Bible as a source of ethical advice. Even Harry Potter is superior to the Bible, both as a work of literary art and as moral philosophy. The real difficulty is in that "neutral reading" part.
## An Alien God
Evolution is a theory that lets purpose creep into Nature at random. But there's a lot more to evolutionary theory than pointing at Nature.
## The Wonder of Evolution
Evolution resolves the infinite regression, not by being super-clever and super-efficient, but by being stupid and inefficient and working anyway. Evolution is not supposed to explain the origin of life; it does not explain the first replicator, because the first to exist was an RNA strand.
## Evolutions Are Stupid (But Work Anyway)
Writer describes some well-known inefficiencies and limitations of evolutions. Evolutionary Biology 201: Evolution is simple enough that we can calculate exactly how stupid they are.
## Natural Selection's Speed Limit and Complexity Bound
Evolutionary theory is based on copying errors. At equilibrium, the rate at which a detrimental mutation is introduced by copying errors, will equal the rate that it is eliminated by selection. The speed limit on evolution is an upper bound, not an average.
## Beware of Stephen J. Gould
Stephen J. Gould was a hero because he challenged evolutionary biologists' romantic notions of progress. Gould's reputation is mud not because he was wrong, but because he misrepresented science.
## The Tragedy of Group Selectionism
Before 1966, biologists believed that predators would voluntarily restrain their breeding to avoid overpopulating their habitat and exhausting the prey population. But evolution does not open the floodgates to arbitrary purposes. The only way the restraining gene can survive against this pressure is if the benefits of restraint preferentially go to restrainers.
## Fake Selfishness
A self-proclaimed selfish person told a friend that he should be selfish as well. The friend asked: If you're so selfish, why do you want to persuade me to be selfish too? Do you start out by thinking that you wanted to be  selfish, then decide this was the most selfish thing you could possibly do?
## Fake Morality
If you fear the prospect of God not punishing some deed, that is a moral compass. You can simply not do whatever you are afraid God may not punish you for doing.
## Fake Optimization Criteria
The mirror challenge for decision theory is seeing which option a choice criterion really endorses. If your stated moral principles call for you to provide laptops to everyone, does that really endorse buying a $1 million gem-studded laptop for yourself?
## Adaptation-Executers, not Fitness-Maximizers
Psychologists John Tooby and Leda Cosmides: Taste buds are shaped by evolutionary history. Tooby: "Individual organisms are best thought of as adaptation-executers rather than as fitness-maximizers"
## Evolutionary Psychology
An evolutionary theory of evolution. The brain is a reproductive organ as surely as your liver. Human emotion of anger comes from ancestors having more kids.
## Protein Reinforcement and DNA Consequentialism
Protein computers and sensors can learn by looking, much faster than DNA can learn. It takes millions of years to build complex machines this way.
## Thou Art Godshatter
Before the 20th century, not a single human being had an explicit concept of "inclusive genetic fitness" Why weren't we consciously obsessed with inclusive genetic fitness? We have no instinctive revulsion of condoms or oral sex, our brains don't perform a check for reproductive efficacy before granting us sexual pleasure.
## Terminal Values and Instrumental Values
On instinctive level, any human planner behaves as if they distinguish between means and ends. But when people begin explicitly talking about goal systems instead of just wanting things, mentioning "goals" instead of using them, they oft become confused. Humans are experts at planning, not experts on planning.
## Evolving to Extinction
Evolution doesn't operate on particular individuals; individuals keep whatever genes they're born with. The rarer males become, the more reproductively valuable they become to the group, but not to the individual parent.
## No Evolutions for Corporations or Nanodevices
"The laws of physics and the rules of math don't cease to apply," says Perry Metzger. "So long as there are limited resources and multiple competing actors capable of passing on characteristics, you have selection pressure"
## The Simple Math of Everything
For people who can read calculus, and sometimes just plain algebra, the drop-dead basic mathematics of a field may not take that long to learn. The Simple Math of Everything, written for people who are good at math, might not be all that weighty a volume. You should take the highest low-hanging fruit you can reach.
## Conjuring An Evolution To Serve You
In the 1990s, some researchers tried to make evolution work for them. They found that it doesn't always work that way. They were able to get the hen that laid the most eggs, but not the most efficient egg-laying hen. In the end, the hen pecked its way to the top of the pecking order.
## Artificial Addition
Peano Ar arithmetic as we know it has not been invented. The best experts in the field estimate it will be at least a hundred years before calculators can add as well as a human twelve-year-old.
## Truly Part Of You
Artificial Intelligence Meets Natural Stupidity is a book about Artificial Intelligence. It's written by Drew McDermott, who criticized AI programs that represent notions like happiness by LISP tokens. McDermott says, "A good test for the disciplined programmer is to try using gensyms in key places"
## Not for the Sake of Happiness (Alone)
The value of scientific discovery requires both a genuine scientific discovery, and a person to take joy in that discovery. It is an undeniable fact that we tend to do things that make us happy, but this doesn't mean we should regard the happiness as the only reason for so acting. We can value something for its own sake and also value it as a means to an end.
## Leaky Generalizations
Followup to: Terminal Values and Instrumental Values.
## The Hidden Complexity of Wishes
Wish for Immortality is an open-source open source computer program. The program has a built-in time machine. It allows users to wish for a variety of outcomes.
## Lost Purposes
No Child Left Behind Act and similar legislation are partly to blame for poor science education, he says. "You don't get to set the rules of the game, and if you try to play by different rules, you'll just lose," he writes.
## Purpose and Pragmatism
There is a deep similarity between the pragmatic and the epistemic arts of rationality. Both cases deal with leaky generalizations about conditional probabilities: P(Y=y|X=x) is nearly but not quite 1. Usefulness for prediction is one of the best indicators of truth.
## The Affect Heuristic
The affect heuristic is when subjective impressions of goodness/badness act as a heuristic - a source of fast, perceptual judgments. The heuristic comes with lovely biases - some of my favorites are as follows. Some people think they are more likely to win when there are more red beans in a bowl.
## Evaluability (And Cheap Holiday Shopping)
If you buy someone a $45 scarf, you are more likely to be seen as generous than if you buy them a $55 coat. An earlier experiment, Hsee (1996), asked subjects how much they would be willing to pay for a second-hand music dictionary.
## Unbounded Scales, Huge Jury Awards, & Futurism
"Psychophysics" is the field that links physical effects to sensory effects. When you use an unbounded scale, the observer is typically presented with a constant stimulus, the modulus, which is given a fixed rating. But what happens if you give subjects an unbound scale, but no modulus? 0 to infinity, with no reference point for a fixed value? Then they make up their own modulus.
## The Halo Effect
Research has shown that we automatically assign to good-looking individuals such favorable traits as talent, kindness, honesty, and intelligence. We make these judgments without being aware that physical attractiveness plays a role in the process. Some consequences of this unconscious assumption that "good-looking equals good" scare me.
## Superhero Bias
The halo effect is that perceptions of all positive traits are correlated. Profiles rated higher on scales of attractiveness, are also rated higher in other categories. The point of non-violent resistance is not to show off your courage.
## Mere Messiahs
John Perry was a New York City police officer who also happened to be an Extropian and transhumanist. He was due to retire shortly and start his own law practice, when word came that a plane had slammed into the World Trade Center.
## Affective Death Spirals
The halo effect is that any perceived positive characteristic (such as attractiveness or strength) increases perception of any other positive characteristic. The more phenomena you use your favored theory to explain, the truer it seems. The resonance of positive affect is like a chamber full of mousetraps loaded with ping-pong balls.
## Resist the Happy Death Spiral
The happy death spiral starts when you believe something is so wonderful that the halo effect leads you to find more and more nice things to say about it, making you see it as even more wonderful. The standard negative things to saying about science, aren't likely to appeal to someone who genuinely feels the exultation of science. The solution is to believe true things, rather than believing things that you believe are false.
## Uncritical Supercriticality
An argument over whether atheism is a "religion" can be lost in the debate. Arguments are soldiers of the mind-killer: once you know which side you're on, you must support all favorable claims and argue against all unfavorable claims. If you feel like you get credit for each nice thing you say about God, and argue about it about other things, it's like stabbing your friends in the back.
## Fake Fake Utility Functions
Fake Utility Functions is an idea of what a simple optimization criterion implies. It's a good way to show that not everything in the universe is subject to significant selection pressures.
## Fake Utility Functions
People who think they know how to program a superintelligence are usually wrong. A superintelligence that wants everything for us that we want for ourselves, except the human values relating to controlling your own life and achieving your own goals, is one of the oldest dystopias.
## Evaporative Cooling of Group Beliefs
Cult members often come back stronger than before, with increased belief and fanaticism. The Jehovah's Witnesses placed Armageddon in 1975, based on Biblical calculations; 1975 has come and passed. The Unarian cult, still going strong today, survived the nonappearance of an intergalactic spacefleet on September 27, 1975.
## When None Dare Urge Restraint
When 9/11 happened, no one would dare to be the voice of restraint, of proportionate response. Anyone who attacks the Enemy is a patriot; and whoever dissects a patriotic claim is a traitor. Once restraint becomes the norm, the level of fury and folly and folly will only rise with time. There is simply too much damage done by spirals of hate.
## The Robbers Cave Experiment
The study involved 22 middle-class Protestant boys from Oklahoma City. The boys were divided into two groups of 11 campers. The researchers tried to reduce friction between the two groups.
## Misc Meta
Overcoming Bias now has a new Welcome page. The "Contributors" section now contains only individuals who have made 3 or more posts. The recent post "When None Dare Urge Restraint" rose to #1 on Reddit.
## Every Cause Wants To Be A Cult
Cade Metz at The Register alleges that a secret mailing list of Wikipedia's top administrators has become obsessed with banning all critics and possible critics of Wikipedia.
## Reversed Stupidity Is Not Intelligence
People who claim to have seen the "mysterious disks" are likely to be wrong, says author. "I don't believe there are any poorly hidden aliens infesting these parts," says writer. "My disbelief has nothing to do with the awful embarrassing irrationality of flying saucer cults," he says.
## Argument Screens Off Authority
Black Belt Bayesian (aka "steven") tries to explain the asymmetry between good arguments and good authority.
## Hug the Query
Rationalists try to find evidence that is as near to the original question as possible. The more directly your arguments bear on a question, without intermediate inferences, the more powerful the evidence.
## Guardians of the Truth
Reversed stupidity is not intelligence: to arrive at a poor conclusion requires only one wrong step, not every step wrong. The Inquisition believed that there was such a thing as truth and that it was important; well, likewise Richard Feynman. But the Inquisitors were not Truth-Seekers. They were Truth-Guardians.
## Guardians of the Gene Pool
The concept of progress is a common one in the 21st century. It is hard to imagine a world without progress, but it is possible.
## Guardians of Ayn Rand
Ayn Rand's novels glorify technology, capitalism, individual defiance of the System, limited government, private property, selfishness. Her ultimate fictional hero, John Galt, was a scientist who invented a new form of cheap renewable energy. Now that Rand is dead, Objectivism is closed. If you disagree with Rand's works in any respect, you cannot be an Objectivist.
## The Litany Against Gurus
I am your hero! encompass me! Transform me! I am your master! I was never your city, just a stretch of your road.
## Politics and Awful Art
The constraints of art force us to toss out the first, old, tired phrasing that comes to mind. When you do art about My-Favorite-Idea, you have to hold yourself to the same standard as if you were art about a butterfly.
## Two Cult Koans
A friend said, "You spend all this time listening to your master, and talking of ' rational' this and 'rational' that - you have fallen into a cult!" The master Ougi responded, "If you find a hammer lying in the road and sell it, you may ask a low price or a high one"
## False Laughter
Not all political art is bad art, but satire is a much more demanding art than just punching the Enemy in the nose. Laughter, like most obligatory laughter, has to come naturally. Not laughing at things that are obligatory is a sign of insecurity.
## Effortless Technique
In the Hollywood version of rationality, rationality is a great strain, a great effort, a continuous battle to coerce your mind into a desired shape. The more effort you expend on forcing yourself into the mold, the better the rationalist you must be. This, I think, is an instance of a Lost Purpose. People see that successful folk must sometimes make an effort, and so they conclude that effort of itself is virtuous.
## Zen and the Art of Rationality
No one would mistake my writings for ancient Eastern wisdom. My goals are not the goals of Buddha or Lao Tse. It's not a Buddhist conclusion, but the language owes a nod in the direction of Buddhism.
## The Amazing Virgin Pregnancy
Mary is pregnant. She tells Joseph: "God did it. God made me pregnant." Joseph and Mary are told to tell everyone in Nazareth about the news. Mary tells her friend, Betty, that the rabbi is the father. Mary is left feeling awful about the whole mess.
## Asch's Conformity Experiment
Solomon Asch highlighted a phenomenon now known as "conformity" In the classic experiment, a subject sees a puzzle like the one in the nearby diagram. Three-quarters of the subjects in Asch's experiment gave a "conforming" answer at least once. In terms of group rationality, the proper thing for an honest rationalist to say is, "How surprising, it looks to me like B is the same size as X"
## On Expressing Your Concerns
Asch's Conformity Experiment shows the power of dissent to inspire real conformity. Being a voice of dissent can bring real benefits to the group. But it also (famously) has a cost. And then you have to keep it up.
## Lonely Dissent
Lonely dissent is one of the most commonly, most ostentatiously faked characteristics around. Courage is braving the outright incomprehension of the people around you, when you do something that isn't Standard Rebellion #37.
## To Lead, You Must Stand Up
In Silicon Valley, an attendee shouts, "LISTEN UP, EVERYONE! WE'VE GOT TO GO! OUR TIME HERE HAS PASSED! YOU CAN TALK OUTSIDE IF YOU LIKE! NOW FOLLOW ME... To lead the pack, you must be willing to leave the pack. There is a difference between being serious and being solemn.
## Cultish Countercultishness
The author argues that cults are not separated natural kinds like dogs and cats. He says cults can be like groups of people who have a positive halo effect around their Favorite Thing Ever.
## My Strange Beliefs
Eliezer Yudkowsky is a Research Fellow at the Singularity Institute. He has written numerous posts on transhumanism. "Overcoming Cryonics" commented on a post in which there was exactly one reference to a transhumanist topic.
## Posting on Politics
Iowa and New Hampshire will exercise their Constitutional right to appoint the next President of the United States. I hope you will forgive me if I am, briefly, relevant.
## The Two-Party Swindle
The Robbers Cave Experiment had as its subject 22 twelve-year-old boys. The boys were as similar to each other as the experimenters could arrange. After the researchers instigated contests for prizes rivalry reached a fever pitch.
## The American System and Misleading Labels
The legal status of AIs is ultimately a legislative question, and in the American system of democracy, legislative questions are decided by the Supreme Court. It's actually easier to pay attention to the labels of things than their substances. Try to say aloud the color - not the meaning - of the following letters:REDREDRED. Now say aloud. the meaning of the letters, not their color: Purple.
## Stop Voting For Nincompoops
In a recent special election for California governor, the usual lock of the party structure broke down. As a result there were 135 candidates, one might have thought there would be some genuine voter choice. However, the media swung into action and decided that only a tiny fraction of these candidates would be allowed to get any publicity.
## Rational vs. Scientific Ev-Psych
Prerequisite: Evolutionary Psychology. Existing evidence that men stare into refrigerators is not enough to prove an evolutionary story.
## A Failed Just-So Story
 evolutionary "just-so stories" are prima facie absurdities to serious students of the field.
## But There's Still A Chance, Right?
When someone told me he didn't believe in evolution, I said, "This is not the nineteenth century. We can read the genes. We know humans and chimps are related. It's over." He replied, "But there's still a chance, right?" I don't recall what I said in further response - probably something like "No" - but I remember this occasion because it brought me several insights into the laws of thought as seen by the unenlightened.
## The Fallacy of Gray
"No one is perfect, but some people are less perfect than others" "Everyone is imperfect" is an excellent example of replacing a two-color view with a one-color one. "There is no such thing as "straightforwardly applying economic theory" "The Moon is made of green cheese" is both uncertainties, but they are not the same uncertainty. "A guilty system recognizes no innocents" is a statement that can be applied to any system.
## Absolute Authority
In the world of the unenlightened ones, there is authority and un-authority. What can be trusted, can be trusts; what cannot be trusted you may as well throw away. If scientists have changed their stories ever in their history, then science cannot be a true Authority.
## Infinite Certainty
Followup to: How To Convince Me That 2 + 2 = 3, Absolute Authority.
## 0 And 1 Are Not Probabilities
Infinity is not an integer. negative infinity and positive infinity are not integers. If you mix up infinities with integers, you'll need all sorts of special new inconsistent-seeming behaviors.
## Beautiful Math
The joy of mathematics is inventing mathematical objects, and then noticing that the mathematical objects that you just created have all sorts of wonderful properties that you never intentionally built into them. If you don't recognize these as successive odd numbers, you are still not defeated. Math is a game without a designer, and yet it is eminently playable.
## Expecting Beauty

## Is Reality Ugly?
Followup to: Beautiful Math, Expecting Beauty. In pure math, you don't have to worry about a tiger leaping out of the bushes.
## Beautiful Probability
Bayesians expect probability theory to be "neat" or "clean" or even "self-consistent"
## Trust in Math
Writer: Mathematical proof that 2 = 1 is not "perfectly logical" is not proof that math is consistent. He says the proof is consistent over the last ten million theorems proved in it, but there is a high probability that if you examine the proof for a flaw you will find one.
## Rationality Quotes 1
I'll be moving to Redwood City, CA in a week, so forgive me if I don't get a regular post out every day between now and then. As a substitute offering, some items from my (offline) quotesfile.
## Rationality Quotes 2
"We don't do science for the general public. We do it for each other" -- Noam Chomsky. "Most witches don't believe in gods. It would be like believing in the postman" -- Terry Pratchett. "We have to be more moral than God" -- Samantha Atkins.
## Rationality Quotes 3
"Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away" "I'd rather live with a good question than a bad answer" "You can't lose well against me, no matter the form"
## The Allais Paradox
Followup to But There's Still A Chance Right?, Beautiful Probability. The Allais Paradox was one of the first conflicts between decision theory and human reasoning to be experimentally exposed.
## Zut Allais!
The Allais Paradox is a study of how people react when given opportunities to bet on a game. It is based on the idea of preference reversals, dynamic inconsistency, and money pumps.
## Rationality Quotes 4
"The primary thing when you take a sword in your hands is your intention to cut the enemy, whatever the means" -- Miyamoto Musashi, The Book of Five Rings. "In the very long run the concern of you people is with the absolute good, ahead of all else. You are like fanatics. Your masters, at any rate"
## Allais Malaise
The Allais Paradox has nothing to do with believing that every added dollar is equally useful. If satisfying your intuitions is more important to you than money, do whatever the heck you want. Don't confuse being rational with being shortsighted or greedy.
## Against Discount Rates
In a recent interview, Carl Shulman argued against the idea of a 5% discount rate in our pure preferences. He said that it is fundamentally 5% more important that a poverty-stricken family have clean water in 2008, than that a similar family haveclean water in 2009.
## Circular Altruism
Torture vs. dust specks: Does it matter? A human life is worth far more than your brain's feelings of comfort or discomfort with a plan. Research shows that there are "sacred values" and "unsacred values", like money.

"Gnostic: Knowledge that is so pure that it cannot be explained or proven wrong" "I haven't been wrong since 1961, when I thought I made a mistake" "Philosophy is the art of asking the wrong questions" "The future is coming, Bill Joy. Like a juggernaut. There'll be no slowing it down"
## Rationality Quotes 7
"A rock pile ceases to be a rock pile the moment a single man contemplates it" "I feel more like I do now than I did a while ago" "When one encounters Evil, the only solution is violence, actual or threatened. That's all Evil understands" "Open Source Software: There are days when I can't figure out whether I'm living in a Socialist utopia or a Libertarian one"
## Rationality Quotes 8
"A committee cannot be wrong - only divided" "An open mind is a great place for other people to dump their garbage" "I am human enough to tell you to go to hell"
## Rationality Quotes 9
"A world ought to have a few genuine good guys, and not just a spectrum of people running from bad to worse" "Behind bars, a man never reforms. He will never forget. He never will get completely over the memory of the bars"
## The "Intuitions" Behind "Utilitarianism"
Followup to: Circular Altruism. Response to: Knowing your argumentative limitations, OR "one [rationalist's] modus ponens is another's modus tollens"
## Trust in Bayes
Trust in Math is not a matter of blind faith. When we see apparent evidence against algebra's trustworthiness, we should also take into account the massive evidence favoring algebra which we have previously encountered.
## Something to Protect
In the X saga, each of the good guys draw their power from having someone - one person - who they want to protect. But if that person is killed, or hurt in the wrong way, the protector loses their power. This isn't something that happens once per week per good guy, the way it would work in a Western comic.
## Newcomb's Problem and Regret of Rationality
Omega, a superintelligence from another galaxy, comes to Earth and sets about playing a strange little game. Everyone who took both boxes has found box B empty and received only a thousand dollars; everyone who took only box B has found B containing a million dollars.
## OB Meetup: Millbrae, Thu 21 Feb, 7pm
The Overcoming Bias meetup has been scheduled for Thursday, February 21st, at 7pm. We're going to look at locating this in Millbrae within walking distance of the BART / Caltrain station. If you would be able to make Thursday the 21st,. 7pm, inMillbrae, somewhere near the BART/Caltrain, please vote below.
## The Parable of the Dagger
Court jester presented the king with two boxes. On the first box was inscribed: "Either this box contains an angry frog, or the box with a false inscription contains an happy frog" On the second box was: "This box contains the key" The king opened the wrong box and was savaged by an angry frogs.
## The Parable of Hemlock
"All men are mortal, and Socrates is a man; and if a mortal drink hemlock, surely he dies" -- Aristotle. "All humans are mortal; Socrates is human; therefore Socrates is mortal" is a logically valid truth. "Syllogisms" are valid in all possible worlds, even those where humans never existed.
## Words as Hidden Inferences
Aristotle laid down rules under which no one could conclude Socrates was "human" until after he died. Nonetheless, Aristotle and his students went on concluding that living people were humans and therefore mortal.
## Extensions and Intensions
Words as Hidden Inferences are a way of defining concepts in terms of other words. They are a form of "intensionally defined" or "extensional" definition. They can be used to communicate concepts in a way that reflects real experience.
## Buy Now Or Forever Hold Your Peace
You can fund your account with up to $250 using a credit card, and it should land in your account immediately.Remember that you can sell contracts at any time afterward - you don't have to wait months to collect your payout. Prediction markets do not have supernatural insight.
## Similarity Clusters
No dictionary, no encyclopedia, has ever listed all the things that humans have in common. With the right set of necessary-and-sufficient gene sequences you could single out all humans, and only humans - at least for now.
## Typicality and Asymmetrical Similarity
Cognitive psychologists study "typicality effects" and "prototype effects" Reaction times are faster for more central examples. People are more likely to expect a disease to spread from robins to ducks than from ducks to robins.
## The Cluster Structure of Thingspace
The notion of a "configuration space" is a way of translating object descriptions into object positions. You can see a robin as a single point in a configuration space whose dimensions describe everything we know about the robin.
## Disguised Queries
A factory worker is told that blue egg-shaped objects are called "bleggs" and go in the "blegr bin" Red cubes are called 'rubes' and go into the 'rube bin' Bleggs have fur on their surface, while rubes are smooth. The sorting scanner tells you whether to put the object into the blegg or the rube bin.
## Neural Categories
A neural network can be used to predict the characteristics of objects. It can be trained by learning rules similar to Hebb's Rule. It is not possible to train a network in real time.
## How An Algorithm Feels From Inside
In Disguised Queries I introduce the blegg/rube classification task. The question "Is it a blegg?" stands in for the disguised query, "Will it glow in the dark?" If you find a blue egg-shaped object that contains palladium, the answer depends on what you ask.
## Disputing Definitions
Arguments about the meaning of the word "sound" can go the route of disputing over definitions. Albert: "The tree produces acoustic vibrations. By definition, that is a sound" Barry: "No one hears anything. Bydefinition, that's not a sound." Albert: 'Hah! Definition in Merriam-Webster: Mechanical energy transmitted by longitudinal pressure waves' Barry: 'Sound in Mechanical Dictionary: ' Mechanical energy in longitudinal waves'
## Feel the Meaning
Human brains can transfer thoughts to each other. The brain doesn't know that it's doing it. The "language" of words is so complex that it can't be easily understood.
## The Argument from Common Usage
Claims that a dictionary determines the meaning of a word. Authoritative Dictionary of IEEE Standards is an example of proper usage. Albert assumes that Barry is accusing him of breaking the agreement.
## Empty Labels
Aristotelian logic is based on the idea that "you can define a word any way you like" The idea came from the notion of categories, which are arbitrary. Aristotelians know perfectly well that Socrates was human, even though he wasn't justified under his rules.
## Classic Sichuan in Millbrae, Thu Feb 21, 7pm
Dinner is scheduled for 7:00pm, on Thursday, February 21st, 2008. 15 people said they would "Definitely" attend and an additional 27 said "Maybe". Robin Hanson will be there too.
## Taboo Your Words
In the game Taboo (by Hasbro), the objective is for a player to have their partner guess a word written on a card without using that word or five additional words listed on the card. You get a very different picture of what people agree or disagree about, depending on whether you take a label's-eye-view (Albert says "sound" and Barry says "not sound", so they must disagree) or taking the test's-eyes-view. "Artificial Intelligence" taboo, and ask them to describe what they expect to see, without ever using words like "computers" or "think", and you might find quite a conflict of expectations hiding under that featureless standard word.
## Replace the Symbol with the Substance
Rationalist version of Taboo is where the goal is not to find a synonym that isn't on the card, but to describe without the standard concept-handle. You have to make your mind's eye see the details, as though looking for the first time.
## Fallacies of Compression
The map of reality is written on a few pounds of neurons, folded up to fit inside your skull. By default, the map is compressed, so certain things that are distinct in reality will be compressed into the same point on your map. The act of creating two different buckets that is the stroke of genius insight.
## Categorizing Has Consequences
People with blood type A are earnest and creative, while people with bloodtype B are wild and cheerful. People with type O are agreeable and sociable, while those with type AB are cool and controlled. Blood type plays the role in Japan that astrological signs play in the West, right down to blood type horoscopes in the daily newspaper.
## Sneaking in Connotations
The Oxford English Dictionary defines "wiggin" as "a person with green eyes and black hair" But the word has other meanings, such as criminal proclivities and culinary peculiarities. The human mind passes from observed characteristics to inferred characteristics.
## Arguing "By Definition"
When people argue definitions, they usually start with some visible, known, or at least widely believed set of characteristics. The legal inference is based on the cluster structure of the environment and the causal structure of biology. We can legitimately see that Socrates is human-shaped, and predict his vulnerability to hemlock.
## Where to Draw the Boundary?
The author argues that the meaning of the word "art" is not found by defining it. He says that there is no single definition of art, but rather a series of similar things that are similar to each other and have a common cause.
## Entropy, and Short Codes
If you have eight possible states in a system, the entropy of that state is 3 bits. This means that, on average, we'll have to ask 3 yes-or-no questions to find out X's value. The code for a system Y is 1.75 bits, meaning that we can find out its value by asking 1. 75 yes- or- no questions.
## Mutual Information, and Density in Thingspace
Entropy of X, as defined yesterday, is 3 bits; we'll need to ask 3 yes-or-no questions to find out X's exact state. The entropy of Y, as. defined yesterday,. is 2 bits, so we have to ask 2. yes- or-no Questions to find Y's exact. state. Learning X tells us one bit of information about Y (cuts down the space of possibilities from 4 to 2, a factor-of-2 decrease in the volume) and learning Y tells us a bit of info about X (cuts the possibility space from 8 to 4)
## Superexponential Conceptspace, and Simple Words
The concept of Conceptspace is a space that contains everything that could exist in Thingspace. It contains dimensions for every possible attribute, including correlated attributes like density and volume. The "Conceptspace" format allows us to represent any variable we encounter that we could encounter.
## Leave a Line of Retreat
The principle behind the technique is simple: As Sun Tzu advises you to do with your enemies, you must do with yourself - leave yourself a line of retreat. The hope is that it takes less courage to visualize an uncomfortable state of affairs as a thought experiment, than to consider how likely it is to be true.
## The Second Law of Thermodynamics, and Engines of Cognition
According to our modern view of physics, energy is conserved in each individual interaction of particles. No matter how large an assemblage of particles may be, it cannot produce energy from nothing - not without violating what we presently believe to be the laws of physics. The essential physical law underlying the Second Law of Thermodynamics is a theorem which can be proven within the standard model of physics: In the development over time of any closed system, phase space volume is conserving.

## Words as Mental Paintbrush Handles
For decades, there was a serious debate about whether people really had mental images in their mind. This was mostly a deranged legacy of behaviorism, which denied the existence of thoughts in humans. Today we can actually neuroimage the little pictures in the visual cortex. So your brain really does represent a detailed image of what it sees or imagines.
## Rationality Quotes 10
"Faith is Hope given too much credit" "Each problem that I solved became a rule which served afterwards to solve other problems" "Intelligence is silence, truth being invisible" "The longer I live the more I see that I am never wrong about anything"
## Rationality Quotes 11
"The trajectory to hell is paved with locally-good intentions" "To a mouse, cheese is cheese; that's why mousetraps work" "Revolutions begin not when the first barricades are erected, but when people realize that fundamental change is possible"
## Variable Question Fallacies
Many words we use are really functions of implicit variables supplied by context. You cannot just bull ahead on every occasion with "Either it does or it doesn't!" A variable question fallacy often aren't neatly labeled.
## 37 Ways That Words Can Be Wrong
This list of 37 ways to use words incorrectly includes the words "wrong", "unwisely" and "unreasonably" It's a list of ways in which words fail to connect to reality in the first place.
## Gary Gygax Annihilated at 69
Gary Gygax, the inventor of Dungeons and Dragons, has died at 69. "I don't understand, I truly don't, why that of all deaths should affect me the way it does," says author.
## Dissolving the Question
If a tree falls in the forest, but no one hears it, does it make a sound? This is not a rhetorical question! It is a fact about human psychology that people think they have free will. Finding a more defensible philosophical position doesn't change, or explain, that psychological fact. Philosophy may lead you to reject the concept, but rejecting a concept is not the same as understanding the cognitive algorithms behind it.
## Wrong Questions
Where the mind cuts against reality's grain, it generates wrong questions. Unanswerable questions can only be dissolved by understanding the cognitive algorithm that generates the perception of a question.
## Righting a Wrong Question
When you are faced with an unanswerable question, there is a simple trick which can turn the question solvable. Ask yourself "Why do I think I have free will?" If you do, in fact, believe you have freeWill, you have a solid chain of cognitive cause and effect leading up to this belief.
## Mind Projection Fallacy
In the dawn days of science fiction, alien invaders would occasionally kidnap a girl in a torn dress and carry her off for intended ravishing. T. Jaynes used the term Mind Projection Fallacy to denote the error of projecting your own mind's properties into the external world.
## Probability is in the Mind
E. T. Jaynes coined the term "Mind Projection Fallacy" to refer to the problem of how probabilities are expressed in the mind, not in the environment. The argument runs thus: You have a coin. The coin is biased. But you don't know which way it's biased or how much. There is no "probability" in the coin, just one state of partial information.
## The Quotation is not the Referent
In classical logic, the operational definition of identity is that whenever 'A=B' is a theorem, you can substitute 'A' for 'B' in any theorem where B appears. John believes Mary believes that the morning star is Lucifer, but the evening star is the god Venus.
## Penguicon & Blook
One million cumulative daily visits! Woot n' stuff. Also we're in the top 5,000 of all blogs on Technorati. I'll be appearing at Penguicon, a combination open-source/science-fiction convention.
## Qualitatively Confused
The Quotation is in the Mind, not the Referent. The dichotomy between belief and disbelief, being binary, is confusingly similar to the dichotomies between truth and untruth. The problem is with qualitative thinking about beliefs.
## Reductionism
Reductionism is not so much a positive hypothesis, as the absence of belief in a form of the Mind Projection Fallacy. It is a type of antireductionism that rejects the idea that there is a single theory that explains the world.
## Explaining vs. Explaining Away
John Keats's Lamia (1819) surely deserves some kind of award for Most Famously Annoying Poetry. Anti-reductionists don't get about reductionism.
## Fake Reductionism
John Keats drank "Confusion to the memory of Newton" because "he destroyed the poetry of the rainbow by reducing it to a prism" He'd been told that the rainbow had been reduced, but it had not actually been reduced in his model of the world.
## Savanna Poets
"Poets say science takes away from the beauty of the stars - mere globs of gas atoms" - Richard Feynman. "What kind of poet can write about Jupiter the god, but not Jupiter the immense sphere?" - Keats. If Jupiter is an immense spinning sphere of methane and ammonia, humans are like humans.
## Joy in the Merely Real
John Keats: "We know her woof, her texture; she is givenIn the dull catalogue of common things" Richard Feynman: "Nothing is inherently mysterious - nothing that actually exists, that is"
## Joy in Discovery
The joy of being the first person to solve a major mystery is a tremendous high, says Lagrange. The joy of scientific discovery has to be about scarcity, he says. Lagrange: If the joy of discovery is one-shot per discovery, then from a fun-theoretic perspective, Newton probably used up a substantial increment in total Physics over the entire history of the world.

## If You Demand Magic, Magic Won't Help
Terry Pratchett ponders the philosophy of fantasy stories. He says that if there were actually dragons in our world, our stories would be less exciting. He argues that if you don't have the capacity to enjoy hang-gliding even though it is merely real, then as soon as dragons turn real, you're not going to be any more excited by dragons than you are by hang- GLiders. The grass is always greener on the other side of unreality.
## New York OB Meetup (ad-hoc) on Monday, Mar 24, @6pm
Eliezer Yudkowsky is in New York, and will have some time free on Monday night, March 24th, to meet any interested New York Overcoming Bias readers.
## The Beauty of Settled Science
If you only care about scientific issues that are controversial, you will end up with a head stuffed full of garbage. "Newsworthy" science is often based on the thinnest of evidence and wrong half the time.
## Amazing Breakthrough Day: April 1st
April 1st is Amazing Breakthrough Day, a day when scientists celebrate scientific breakthroughs. In the past, there have been many humanly understandable amazing breakthroughs in the history of science, which can be understood without a PhD or even BSc.
## Is Humanism A Religion-Substitute?
If space launches and a rocket rise and you want to sing, then write the song, writes author. Atheists who write hymns to the nonexistence of God are imitative and awful, says philosopher. A good "atheistic hymn" is simply a song about anything worth singing that doesn't happen to be religious.
## Scarcity
Robert Cialdini's Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion.
## To Spread Science, Keep It Secret
Scientist says science should be made public, not secret. He argues that science is more valuable when it is in limited supply. He says the problem is that people don't want to study science in the first place. He believes that science could be better served if it were kept secret.
## Initiation Ceremony
Brennan's sandals clicked softly on the stone steps, snicking in sequence, like dominos very slowly falling. The room was lined, wall-to-wall, with figures robed and hooded in light-absorbing cloth. The straight walls were not themselves black stone, but mirrored, tiling a square grid of dark robes.
## Hand vs. Fingers
Reductionism is the view that physical reality is a single level. This is one of the ideas behind the Mind Projection Fallacy. Theory is that we use multi-level models for computational reasons.
## Angry Atoms
Theory of hand vs. fingers: Fundamental physics far removed from the levels we can see, like hands and fingers. We can't actually see the identity between levels - no one has a brain large enough to visualize avogadros of quarks and recognize a hand-pattern in them. But we at least understand what hands do: Hands push on things, exert forces on them.
## Heat vs. Motion
The equivalence of heat and motion may seem too obvious in hindsight. There was a time when the kinetic theory of heat was a highly controversial scientific hypothesis, contrasting to belief in a caloric fluid that flowed from hot objects to cold objects.
## Brain Breakthrough! It's Made of Neurons!
 Nobel laureate Santiago Ramón y Cajal leads team of scientists. They say the brain is composed of tiny cells connected to each other by infinitesimal threads and branches. Team says the discovery offers strong experimental evidence that Spinoza and Descartes were wrong.
## Reductive Reference
Reality is single-level in the sense that it does not seem to contain atoms as separate, additional, causally efficacious entities over and above quarks. Truth can't be evaluated just by looking inside your own head - if you want to know, for example, whether "the morning star = the evening star" is true, you need a telescope.
## Zombies! Zombies?
Zombie argument is that consciousness is extra-physical. It argues that zombies are "possible" and therefore have inner listeners. This means that they are conscious, even if they are not conscious.
## Zombie Responses
Richard Chappell says: "What is consciousness?" is asking a legitimate question, has a legitimate demand for insight. I don't necessarily think that the answer takes the form of "Here is this stuff that has all the properties you would attribute to consciousness"
## The Generalized Anti-Zombie Principle
Consciousness is not epiphenomenal; your mind can catch the inner listener in the act of listening, and say so out loud. The Anti-Zombie Principle says, "Any change that does not affect you in any way is not a reasonable stipulation to say that consciousness is not real"
## GAZP vs. GLUT
Generalized Anti-Zombie Principle (GAZP) discusses the 'GLUT' - a non-conscious system that animates a zombie and makes it talk about consciousness. GLUT is not a zombie in the classic sense, because it is microphysically dissimilar to a human.
## Belief in the Implied Invisible
The Anti-Zombie Argument is a general rule that anything you can't see doesn't exist. The general rule is tempting, but it's not Bayesian. Occam's Razor doesn't penalize galaxies for being big. A model of the universe that contains billions of galaxies containing billions of stars will take a lot of RAM to run.
## Quantum Explanations
Quantum Physics Sequence: The goal is to become completely at home in a quantum universe. The traditional introduction to quantum mechanics closely follows the order in which quantum mechanics was discovered. I'm not going to tell you that quantum mechanics is supposed to be confusing.
## Configurations and Amplitude
Early scientists were confused about what the results meant. The half-silvered mirror obeys the same rule every time. The universe isn't made of little billiard balls.
## Joint Configurations
 quantum mechanics is about more than one particle, says physicist.
## Distinct Configurations
The identity of configurations is nailed down - you can't reorganize configurations the way you can regroup possible worlds. Unlike possible worlds, configurations cannot be regrouped on a whim. Each configuration is about every particle.
## Where Philosophy Meets Science
The origin of quantum theory was not understood by early scientists. They didn't realize that a person's thoughts can be used to understand other people's thoughts. They also didn't see that the "observation" of a particle was just a way of making a point, not a fact.
## Can You Prove Two Particles Are Identical?
Quantum Physics Sequence: Where Philosophy Meets Science, Joint configurations.
## Classical Configuration Spaces
This post is part of the Quantum Physics Sequence. In quantum physics, a configuration space is a way of visualizing the state of an entire system as a single point in a higher-dimensional space.
## The Quantum Arena
Quantum physics uses complex amplitudes, rather than probability distributions. Complex amplitudes take up 2 of our 3 dimensions. This makes it harder to maintain the illusion of individuality.
## Feynman Paths
The key to recovering the possibility of quantum physics from the classical hallucination is the kind of behavior that we see in this mirror. Most of the possible paths add up and cancel out each other. Most amplitude comes from a small group of neighboring paths, and only a small part of this group of paths adds up.
## No Individual Particles
Quantum Physics: How Two Particles Are Identical? explains why two electrons are entirely indistinguishable - not just indistinguishable according to known measurements of mass and electrical charge. "Quantum entanglement" is not some extra, special, additional bond between two particles. The special and unusual case is quantum independence. A single point in quantum configuration space is the product of multiple point positions per quantum field.
## Identity Isn't In Specific Atoms
The Generalized Anti-Zombie Principle is a theory of the universe. It is based on the idea that there are no individual atoms in the universe, but only multiplicative ones.
## Zombies: The Movie
Zombies are 'philosophical zombies' who behave exactly like humans, except that they're not conscious. Doctors have tried every placebo in the book to cure the disease. They believe that the disease must operate outside our universe.
## Three Dialogues on Identity
This post is part of the Quantum Physics Sequence. For more information on the Sequence, visit www.quantumphysics.org.
## Decoherence
The evolution of a quantum system can produce entanglement where there was formerly independence. The process is called "decoherence"
## The So-Called Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
This post is part of the Quantum Physics Sequence. Last in the series: Decoherence.
## Which Basis Is More Fundamental?
Quantum physics is not "fundamental", but rather just a way of making predictions. The "Tao" of physics is the distribution from which our laws of physics were drawn. This is almost certainly a false concept, but it is a useful one.
## Where Physics Meets Experience
Ebborians reproduce by fission, an adult dividing into two new individuals. They share genetic material, but not through sexual recombination. Ebborians think faster than humans and remember less. They have no concept of parents, children, or sexuality.
## Where Experience Confuses Physicists
Po'mi of Ebbore finds himself in both worlds, every time. He can't predict exactly which world he will end up in. But he can predict probabilistically which one he will be in. And science vindicates his theory.
## On Being Decoherent
Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: Quantum systems evolve in ways they "could" behave. Evolution of quantum systems is a sum over histories.
## The Conscious Sorites Paradox
The theory of quantum mechanics is that there are two states, and that they can't be distinguished. But when do the two states interact? And when do they cease to interact? This is the crucial question.
## Decoherence is Pointless

## Decoherence as Projection
This post is part of the Quantum Physics Sequence.Previously in series: The Born Probabilities. In "The So-Called Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle" we got a look at how decoherence can affect the apparent surface properties.
## Entangled Photons
This post is part of the Quantum Physics Sequence. previously in series: Decoherence as Projection.
## Bell's Theorem: No EPR "Reality"
Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen once argued that no signal can possibly travel between entangled particles, light-years or at least light-minutes apart. They assumed that the prediction about what you would hear from B described that happened at A, only one thing that could happen at B. They were wrong, and it's an example of how seemingly impeccable philosophy can fail in the face of experimental evidence.
## Spooky Action at a Distance: The No-Communication Theorem
Bell's Theorem: Entanglement: No EPR "Reality" "Spooky action at a distance" is a result of the 'decoherence' of entangled particles. If you measure photon A to be polarized at 0°, photon B knows that it should have the opposite polarization of 90°.
## Decoherence is Simple
This post is part of the Quantum Physics Sequence. The author is a Bayesian, not a physicist.
## Decoherence is Falsifiable and Testable
This post is part of the Quantum Physics Sequence. It is about the two main theories of decoherence and collapse in quantum mechanics. To understand the difference between the two, we need to look at Bayes's Theorem.
## Quantum Non-Realism
Einstein: "Shut up and calculate" is a strict interpretation of quantum mechanics. He says it is hard for human beings to shut up and calculating - really shut up. But if you do the best that you can do without the correct answer being available, it will turn out that you have not said anything incompatible with decoherence.
## Collapse Postulates
Collapse theories were devised in a time when it simply didn't occur to any physicists that more than one world could exist. People took for granted that measurements had single outcomes - it was an assumption so deep it was invisible, because it was what they saw happening. Collapse theories only postulate one surviving world.
## If Many-Worlds Had Come First
Physicists have long been baffled by the mysterious Born probabilities. Huve Erett presented a new hypothesis to explain the phenomenon. The theory suggests that quantum laws govern at all levels without alteration.
## Many Worlds, One Best Guess
This post is part of the Quantum Physics Sequence: Collapse Postulates. Follows Bell's Theorem, Spooky Action at a Distance, Quantum Non-Realism, Decoherence is Simple, Falsifiable and Testable.
## The Failures of Eld Science
Students were expected to become friends, and allies. Students were either the most promising learners, or those whom the beisutsukai saw political advantage in molding.
## The Dilemma: Science or Bayes?
Many-Worlds doesn't make any new testable predictions. The amazing new phenomena it predicts are all hidden away. The whole thing smacks of fiction.
## Science Doesn't Trust Your Rationality
Many-Worlds and libertarianism are similar in that they are both cases of bullet-swallowing, rather than bullet-dodging. Both are grand philosophical theories that start from premises that almost all educated people accept.
## When Science Can't Help
Eliezer18 had a theory that consciousness was caused by closed timelike curves in quantum gravity. Science would have been perfectly fine with Eliezer spending ten years trying to test his stupid theory, only to get a negative experimental result, so long as he said, "Oh, well, I guess my theory was wrong"
## Science Isn't Strict Enough
The traditional ideals of Science too readily give out gold stars, so everyone who plays gets an award, says Eliezer18. So long as most scientists can manage to accept definite, unmistakable, unambiguous experimental evidence, science can progress.
## Do Scientists Already Know This Stuff?
Eliezer18 says he didn't go through the traditional scientific apprenticeship. He says many modern scientists are making the same mistakes.
## No Safe Defense, Not Even Science
Growing up in an Orthodox Jewish family broke my core emotional trust in the sanity of the people around me. Until this core emotionalTrust is broken, you don't start growing as a rationalist. Some aspiring rationalists run into roadblocks around things like cryonics or many-worlds.
## Changing the Definition of Science
Howson is a leading advocate for an alternative view of science based on degrees of belief. At its heart is a fundamental connection between the subjective concept of belief and the cold, hard mathematics of probability.
## Conference on Global Catastrophic Risks
Oxford Future of Humanity Institute is holding a conference on global catastrophic risks on July 17-20, 2008, at Oxford (in the UK) I'll be there, as will Robin Hanson and Nick Bostrom.
## Faster Than Science
Einstein's Arrogance: Science Doesn't Trust Your Rationality. The social process of science leans on extra evidence to overcome cognitive noise.
## Einstein's Speed
The Powers Beyond Science are actually a standard and necessary part of the social process of science. In particular, scientists must call upon their powers of individual rationality to decide what ideas to test.
## That Alien Message
Brennan: In a world where average IQ is 140, Einstein's work no longer seems exceptional. He says the process seems to center around Earth particularly.
## My Childhood Role Model
For us humans, it seems that the scale of intelligence runs from "village idiot" at the bottom to "Einstein" at top. Yet the distance from "Village idiot' to 'Einstein' is tiny in the space of brain designs.
## Mach's Principle: Anti-Epiphenomenal Physics
The Generalized Anti-Zombie Principle is one of the most important ideas in physics. It is not experimentally proven, though it is widely considered to be credible.
## A Broken Koan
At Baycon today and tomorrow. Physics series resumes tomorrow.
## Relative Configuration Space
This post is part of the Quantum Physics Sequence. It draws on the work of physicist Julian Barbour. The ideas in today's post are taken seriously by serious physicists, but they are not experimentally proven.
## Timeless Physics
This post is part of the Quantum Physics Sequence. The central idea in today's post is taken seriously by serious physicists. It is not experimentally proven and is not taught as standard physics.
## Timeless Beauty
Timeless physics says that everything that exists is either perfectly global or perfectly local. Every possible arrangement of particles has a single complex amplitude assigned to it. Timeful quantum physics is pretty, but not all that much prettier than classical physics.
## Timeless Causality
Julian Barbour believes that each configuration, each individual point in configuration space, corresponds individually to an experienced Now. But there is a timeless formulation of causality, known to Bayesians, which may glue configurations together even in a timeless universe.
## Einstein's Superpowers
John Baez's Crackpot Index examines how many people compare themselves to Einstein. Baez: "The underlying problem is conflating social status and research potential" He says that if you claim to have the potential to do what Einstein did, it is just the same as claiming Einstein's rank.
## Class Project
Jeffreyssai told his students to do as well as Einstein. Taji, Brennan, Styrlyn, Hiriwa, Brennan and Yin were shocked by the challenge. They all struggled to think of a way to solve the problem. The students were given one month to come up with a solution. If they succeeded, they would be promoted to the second and sixth level.
## A Premature Word on AI
Followup to: A.I. Old-Timers, Do Scientists Already Know This Stuff? He says he went into the AI field because he thought it was world-crackingly important, but never expected it to be easy.
## The Rhythm of Disagreement
IEEE Spectrum's "Who's Who In The Singularity" includes a chart of Daniel Dennett's thoughts on time horizons. Dennett says human-level AI is "vanishingly unlikely in the foreseeable future" Pinker: "There are many potential reasons to disagree about AI"
## Principles of Disagreement
At 15, a year before he knew what a "Singularity" was, he learned about evolutionary psychology. The peculiar indignation of "How dare you disagree with Einstein?" has its origins here. In practice, it's much more obvious that wavefunctions don't collapse than that I should trust my disagreement.
## Timeless Identity
This post is part of the Quantum Physics Sequence. In No Individual Particles we saw that the intuitive conception of reality as little billiard balls bopping around, is entirely and absolutely wrong. In Identity Isn't In Specific Atoms we kicked hell out of an intuitive concept of personal identity that depends on being made of the "same atoms" In Timeless Physics, we see that there is no such thing as a particular atom.
## Why Quantum?
"Quantum Physics" is a series of posts on quantum physics. In it, Eliezer explains why he believes in many-worlds.
## Living in Many Worlds
Many commenters have expressed disturbance at the thought of constantly splitting into zillions of other people. It is quantum mechanics that adds up to normality. In each world, people choose the course that seems best to them.
## Thou Art Physics
This post is part of the Quantum Physics Sequence and the Solution to "Free Will" The notion of "timeless physics" is causing people to ask, "If the future is determined, how can our choices control it?"
## Timeless Control
Timeless Physics is about the possibility of timeless causality. The "Block Universe" is the classical term for the universe considered from outside Time. The Block Universe is not something that hangs, motionless and static, lasting for a very long time.
## Bloggingheads: Yudkowsky and Horgan
One question I fumbled at 62:30 was "What's the strongest opposition you've seen to Singularity ideas?" The basic problem is that nearly everyone who attacks the Singularity is either completely unacquainted with the existing thinking, or they attack Kurzweil.
## Against Devil's Advocacy
Richard Dawkins once called me a "creep" because I was defending a position I did not truly hold. I was teaching my son about skepticism when I found myself able to invent arguments for anything. I know people whose sanity has been destroyed by this discovery. I've got to avoid doing that.
## Eliezer's Post Dependencies; Book Notification; Graphic Designer Wanted
I need to get at least one Powerpoint presentation of mine re-produced to professional standards of graphic design. This is likely to lead into other graphic design work on producing the ebooks, redesigning my personal website, creating Bayesian Conspiracy T-shirts, etc.

## Quantum Physics Revealed As Non-Mysterious
The series of posts indexed below will show you - not just tell you - what's really going on down there.
## And the Winner is... Many-Worlds!
Macroscopic quantum superpositions, a.k.a. the "many-worlds interpretation" or MWI, was proposed in 1957 and brought to the general attention of the scientific community in 1970.
## Quantum Mechanics and Personal Identity
Quantum mechanics doesn't deserve its fearsome reputation. It's human intuitions that are "strange" or "weird"
## Causality and Moral Responsibility
Even if the system is - gasp!- deterministic, you will see a system that, lo and behold, deterministically adds numbers. Even if someone designed the system, you'll see that it was designed to add numbers. Timeless control is the idea of timeless control: If the result is deterministic and controlled by it is still controlled by that portion of the physics which is "determinism"

Reasoning by analogy is popular as popular as Greek times, but not as popular today as it pertains to Artificial Intelligence. You can't build something that "resembles" the human brain in one surface facet and expect everything else to come out similar. You might as well build your computer in the form of a little person and hope for it to rise up and walk.
## Optimization and the Singularity
Reveals his views on the idea of an optimization process. Says that intelligence and natural selection are special cases of optimization. Believes that evolution and intelligence are just "accidental" processes that produce good designs.
## The Psychological Unity of Humankind
Biological organisms in general, and human brains particularly, contain complex adaptations; adaptations which involve many genes working in concert. Complex adaptations must evolve incrementally, gene by gene. By the time an adaptation gets to be really sophisticated with dozens of genes supporting its highly refined activity, every member of the species has some version of it.

## No Universally Compelling Arguments
I propose that for every argument A, howsoever convincing it may seem to us, there exists at least one possible mind that doesn't buy it in principle. If we restrict ourselves to minds specifiable in a trillion bits or less, then each universal generalization "All minds m: X(m)" has two to the trillionth chances to be false, while each existential generalization that "Exists mind m: Y(m) has two-to-the-trillionth chances of being true.
## 2-Place and 1-Place Words
The Mind Projection Fallacy is based on the idea that sexiness is a one-place function. It is treated as though sexiness were a function of only one argument. The two 2-place and 1-place views can be unified using the concept of "currying"
## The Opposite Sex
Some observations on sex and gender. A good deal of what we think of as "manly" or "womanly" is gender rather than sex. Understanding the opposite sex is hard.
## What Would You Do Without Morality?
"Nothing is real" is not the answer to the question "What would you do if you found out that nothing is right?" The question is: Would you still go to work? Would you stay in bed and read a book? Or would you go out and get drunk and get high? What would you choose?
## The Moral Void
The question: Would you kill babies if it was inherently the right thing to do? The answer: "No" If there is no morality, there's no reason to do such a thing - if it's not "moral", why bother? You can probably see yourself pulling children off train tracks, even if it were not justified. But maximizing inclusive genetic fitness? If this isn't moral, why bother?"
## Created Already In Motion
Lewis Carroll wrote a famous dialogue called What the Tortoise said to Achilles. It is an example of passing the Recursive Buck, a pattern of arguments in which the arguments become longer and longer strings. No argument so compelling that it will give dynamics to a static thing, as with a rock.

## Where Recursive Justification Hits Bottom
"Why do I believe that the Sun will rise tomorrow?" asks one of us. "Because I've seen the Sun rise on thousands of previous days?" asks another. "Science is ultimately based on faith, so don't you criticize me for believing in [silly-belief-#238721]," says another. If every belief must be justified, then how is the infinite recursion terminated?
## The Fear of Common Knowledge
Steven Pinker says that we avoid mutual knowledge because it can be extended to infinity. The idea of a lie that the other person knows is a lie seems odd at first.
## My Kind of Reflection
Reality is not a warrant of trustworthiness; the goal is to win. Our brains are built to assess "simplicity" in the universe. In the case of induction, we've tried to import our notions of Occam's Razor into our own thinking.
## The Genetic Fallacy
The idea that the Bible is written by the hand of God is wrong. The origin of evidence can be relevant to its evaluation, as in the case of a trusted expert. If you have many ideas suggested by a source that you now know to be untrustworthy, you should be suspicious.
## Fundamental Doubts
Recursive Justification is one of the most difficult techniques of rationality. When new suspicion is cast on one of your fundamental sources, you really should doubt all the branches and leaves of that root. Case in point: Morpheus told Neo that the machines were harvesting the body heat of humans for energy, and liquefying the dead to feed to babies. But if the Matrix's makers had cared about the flaw, they could have fixed the plot hole in any of the sequels, in fifteen seconds.
## Rebelling Within Nature
Eliezer Yudkowsky learned about evolutionary psychology as a teenager. He learned that you can't fight Nature from beyond Nature, only from within it. He also learned that some of the things he was doing during his teenage years were not "standard stupid stuff" He says he still rebelled against the rebellious nature the Guide to Parents described.
## Probability is Subjectively Objective
"Subjective Bayesians" believe that "probabilities" are degrees of uncertainty existing in our minds. "objective Bayesian" is anyone who uses Bayesian methods and isn't a subjective Bayesian. E. T. Jaynes once described himself as a "subjective-objectiveBayesian"
## Lawrence Watt-Evans's Fiction

## Could Anything Be Right?
Eliezer1999 was convinced that he knew nothing about morality. He thought that if you built a generic superintelligence then it could reason about what was likely to be right and wrong. But if you have no knowledge at all about "morality", there's also no computational procedure that will seem more likely than others to compute "Morality" And no meta-procedure that's more likely to produce a procedure that computes morality.
## Existential Angst Factory
The moral void is the belief that life is meaningless, and thus suffers existential angst. Most existential angst comes from trying to solve the wrong problem, argues philosopher Timothy Ferris. The answer to happiness is excitement, says Ferris, not boredom.
## Touching the Old
Transhumanism does scare me. I shouldn't wonder if it scares me more than it scares arch-luddites like Leon Kass. Even if something scares you, you can still have the courage to confront it.
## Should We Ban Physics?
Marie Curie died of aplastic anemia, the victim of radiation from the glowing substances she had learned to isolate. What if Curie, by isolating and purifying the glowy stuff, had caused something akin to a fission chain reaction?
## Fake Norms, or "Truth" vs. Truth
There's a social norm in favor of "truth", but there's a difference between "truth" and "honesty" People know that when someone says "truth," they're supposed to applaud, but not when they say "truth is bad" Robin asks how it is that people prevent themselves from noticing the conflict.
## When (Not) To Use Probabilities
The laws of probability are laws, not suggestions, but often the true Law is too difficult for us humans to compute. Sometimes you don't apply probability theory. Especially if you're human, and your brain has evolved with all sorts of useful algorithms for uncertain reasoning, that don't involve verbal probabilities.

## Changing Your Metaethics
People get attached to their metaethics, and insist that if they are wrong, all morality necessarily falls apart. To make philosophical progress, people need to shift metathics at some point in their lives. If your metaethic tells you to kill people, why should you even listen? Maybe that which you would do even if there were no morality, is your morality.
## Setting Up Metaethics
Morality is divided into two camps: morality-as-given and morality-As-preference. Some people see morality as a fixed given, independent of our whims. Others see it as a preference, about which we form changeable beliefs. Both camps must contend with seemingly impossible questions. What we should want is a metaethic that:Adds up to moral normality, including moral errors, moral progress, and things you should do whether you want to or not.
## The Meaning of Right
The key is to understand how a certain cognitive algorithm feels from inside. If you don't know what right-ness is, then take a step beneath and ask how your brain labels things "right" Rightness is contagious backward in time. Pushing the button seems to have more should-ness than not pushing it.

## Humans in Funny Suits
Don't be fooled by the fact that a kangaroo resembles us rather less than does a chimp. A frog, like us, resembles us less than the kangaroos. An alien species to evolve intelligence, it must have two legs with one knee each attached to an upright torso, and must walk in a way similar to us.
## Detached Lever Fallacy
This fallacy gets its name from an ancient sci-fi TV show. It is still quite popular to try to program an AI with "semantic networks" that look something like this. The essential driver of the Detached Lever Fallacy is that the lever is visible, and the machinery is not. It's a truism in evolutionary biology that conditional responses require more genetic responses than unconditional responses.
## A Genius for Destruction
This is a question from a workshop after the Global Catastrophic Risks conference. The question was about the role of "smart people" in disasters. The answer came from someone who observed that it's often our smartest people leading us into disaster.
## The Comedy of Behaviorism
Behaviorism was the doctrine that it was unscientific for a psychologist to ascribe emotions, beliefs, thoughts, to a human being. The origin of behaviorism, was in a backlash against substance dualism - the idea that mind is a separate substance from ordinary physical phenomena. In modern cognitive psychology, there are many ways of handling this kind of problem in a "scientific" way.
## No Logical Positivist I
Eliezer accuses me of reinventing logical positivism, badly.
## Anthropomorphic Optimism
The Tragedy of Group Selectionism was a rather extreme error by a group of early (pre-1966) biologists. The theory was that predators would voluntarily restrain their breeding.
## Contaminated by Optimism
Anthropomorphism is a form of cognitive psychology that leads people to believe anything they want. The Tragedy of Group Selectionism was a case in which early biologists believed that predators would voluntarily restrain their breeding to avoid exhausting the prey population. Anthropomorphism can be harmful, as it encourages people to cling to a false hypothesis.
## Hiroshima Day
On August 6th, in 1945, the world saw the first use of atomic weapons against human targets. Until the end of time we will be a species that has used fission bombs in anger. I wouldn't have thought that humanity could make it this far without using atomic weapons again.
## Morality as Fixed Computation
Eliezer writes: 'I should X' means that I would attempt to X were I fully informed. If you build an AI with the action-determining principle, "Do what I want," it will do what it wants. As a general rule, it is not possible to patch flawed Friendly AI designs. This is the paradoxical-seeming issue which I have analogized to the difference between a calculator and an AI.
## Inseparably Right; or, Joy in the Merely Good
There is no pure ghostly essence of goodness apart from things like truth, happiness and sentient life. No one value that determines whether a complicated event is good or not. Arguments may convince you to change your criteria of what counts as a persuasive argument.
## Sorting Pebbles Into Correct Heaps
Pebblesorting is the sorting of pebbles into correct heaps. Three millennia ago, the Great Leader Biko made a heap of 91 pebbled and proclaimed it correct. Wars have been fought between countries that disagree on which heaps are correct. Heapivists have warned against this project, not being the species Pebbles sapiens.

## When Anthropomorphism Became Stupid
Many earlier cultures believed that animals, rocks, streams, and hills all had spirits. This would have provoked incredulity among many earlier cultures. It's the point where you can look at a tree and say: "I don't see anything in the tree's biology that's doing complex information-processing" Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection and the notion of cognition as computation is where anthropomorphism's descent into being obviously wrong.

## Unnatural Categories
Rationalist: The way that we classify things - never mind events - is non-local, entwined with the consequential structure of the world.
## Magical Categories
Bill Hibbard: AI could be hard-wired to recognize happiness and unhappiness in human facial expressions, human voices and human body language. Hibbard also wrote "Such obvious contradictory assumptions show Yudkowsky's preference for drama over reason" There is no professional certification test you have to take before you are allowed to talk about AI morality.
## Three Fallacies of Teleology
Aristotle distinguished between four senses of the Greek word aition, which in English is translated as "cause" The efficient aition best translates as the English word "cause"; we would think of the artisan carving the statue. The final aition was the goal, or telos, or purpose of the statue, that for the sake of which it exists.
## Dreams of AI Design
Artificial Intelligence is fundamentally about reducing the mental to the non-mental. Many AGI wannabes think they know how minds work, but they don't. Most of the work is carried out beneath your sight.
## Against Modal Logics
In the Wittgensteinian era, philosophy has been about language - about trying to give precise meaning to terms. Gary Drescher's Good and Real is an example of a philosophical work that is commensurate with the kind of thinking I have to try to do.
## Harder Choices Matter Less
The obvious choices, like Pepsi over Coke, will take very little time. Conversely, the choices that take the most time probably make the least difference. If you can't decide between the hamburger and the hot dog, you're either close to indifferent between them, or in your current state of ignorance.
## Qualitative Strategies of Friendliness
Superintelligence would be more effective on both a human scale and even on a human. scale. Human. progress, with merely 200Hz neurons, tends to change the way we do things over a few hundred years. As a result, a "weapon" today is not a weapon of yestercentury "long-distance communication" today. A superintelligence could be more effectively used as a weapon today.
## Dreams of Friendliness
Strong optimization for only some humane values, does not imply a good total outcome. A superintelligence will search out alternate causal pathways to its goals than the ones you had in mind. The boundaries of moral categories are not predictively natural entities. Qualitative reasoning about AIs often revolves around some nodes described by empathic inferences.

## The True Prisoner's Dilemma
In the classic visualization of the Prisoner's Dilemma, you're supposed to pretend that you're entirely selfish.

## Points of Departure
Hollywood sci-fi often depicts AIs as "emotionless" AIs that are depicted as repressed. But these AI's behavior is a result of having a " Standard mind" plus an extra Emotion Suppressor. This is a logical fallacy because it warps Occam's Razor. This fallacy is a fallacy of measuring simplicity in terms of the shortest diff from "normality"
## Rationality Quotes 17

## How Many LHC Failures Is Too Many?
Large Hadron Collider damaged by a mechanical failure. Many commenters said, "Anthropic principle! If the LHC had worked, it would have produced a black hole or strangelet or vacuum failure, and we wouldn't be here!" This remark may be somewhat premature, since I don't think we're yet at the point in time when the L HC would have started producing collisions.
## Horrible LHC Inconsistency
This is a follow-up to a previous post on "How Many LHC Failures Is Too Many?" I realized that I'm horrendously inconsistent with respect to my stated beliefs about disaster risks from the Large Hadron Collider. I would much rather run the LHC than press a button with a known 1/1,000,000 probability of destroying the world.
## That Tiny Note of Discord
Eliezer1997 claimed that any superintelligence would automatically do what was "right" He then thought that some people would prefer an AI do particular things, such as not kill them, even if life is meaningless. He now thinks that this creates a present conflict of interest over the Singularity.

## Above-Average AI Scientists
One of the failure modes I've come to better understand in myself since observing it in others, is what I call, "living in the should-universe" The universe where everything works the way it common-sensically ought to, as opposed to the actual one we live in. The study of Artificial General Intelligence is driven by the one overwhelming fact of the indescribably huge effects.

Every major democratic political leader lies abundantly to obtain office. Is it true that no one who refused to lie could win political office? There are biases that make it hard to believe people who "break the rules" can ever be trusted.
## Which Parts Are "Me"?
Everything I am, is surely my brain; but I don't accept everything my brain does, as "me" It does seem that in taking a step back from myself to look at what my brain is doing, that this introduces a greater emotional distance from the world, than when I am not reflecting. The point at which you start thinking that not everything that goes on your brain is to be identified with "you", is something of a Rubicon, I fear.

## Expected Creative Surprises
If I could predict exactly where my opponent would move on each turn, I would automatically be at least as good a chess player as my opponent. But predicting an exact move is not possible, but neither is it true that I have no information about my opponent's moves. If my opponent has 37 legal moves, I can assign a probability of 1/37 to each move. This makes me perfectly calibrated: I assigned 37 different moves a probability in 37, and exactly one of those moves will happen.
## Belief in Intelligence
Theory of Kasparov is that he is a better chess player than Mr. G, a lesser grandmaster. The degree to which he is better is reflected in the amount of probability mass he concentrates into the "Kasparov wins" class of outcomes.

Intelligence is the ability to predict the future with confidence. Intelligence is a series of beliefs about where Kasparov wants to steer the future. The idea of "aiming at the target" extends beyond just terminal outcomes.
## Measuring Optimization Power
Bayesian view of intelligence is based on the idea of optimization power. Means that a mind can steer reality into regions that are higher in its preference ordering. Bayesian views are based on taking the entropy out of propositional variables that we care about, and dumping it into variables we don't.
## Efficient Cross-Domain Optimization
Deep Blue was able to optimize chess boards to defeat Kasparov, perhaps the most skilled chess player humanity has ever fielded. But Deep Blue never ventured outside the narrow domain that it itself was optimized over.
## Economic Definition of Intelligence?
Intelligence is the ability to use limited resources - including time - to achieve goals. But to define it in terms of a utility function, we need to change the way we think about it. "Intelligence" is not the same as " utility function"
## Intelligence in Economics
Robin: My primary view of the world tends to be through the lens of AI. I see economics as a special case of game theory in which some interactions are highly regular and repeatable. I don't know what economists don't do, so do correct me if this is actually extensively studied. Intelligence plays a role at a larger scale in deciding whether or not to buy a truck, or where to invest money.
## Mundane Magic
Followup to: Joy in the Merely Real, Joy in Discovery, If You Demand Magic, Magic Won't Help. Here's a list of some of my favorite magical powers.
## BHTV: Jaron Lanier and Yudkowsky
My interview with Jaron Lanier is up on Bloggingheads.tv. This ended up being more of me interviewing Lanier than a dialog. There are questions that you're not allowed to answer.
## Building Something Smarter
Artificial intelligence is not a tape-recorder-of-thought which only plays back knowledge given to it by the programmers. Deep Blue played chess barely better than the world's top humans, but a heck of a lot better than its own programmers.
## Complexity and Intelligence
"Complexity" conjures up the image of a huge machine with incomprehensibly many gears inside. But the Kolmogorov complexity of a pattern is the size of the program code of the shortest Turing machine that produces the pattern.
## Today's Inspirational Tale
Voting for a losing candidate is not "thrown away"; it sends a message to mainstream candidates that you vote, but they have to work harder to appeal to your interest group to get your vote. Readers in non-swing states especially should consider what message they're sending with their vote.
## Hanging Out My Speaker's Shingle
Eliezer has decided to hang out his shingle as a speaker at financial companies. If he can monetize by speaking, he's much less likely to try charging for access to his future writings.
## Back Up and Ask Whether, Not Why
When someone asks you "Why are you doing X?", do not ask yourself "Why am I doing X?". Instead, try to blank your mind - maybe not a full-fledged crisis of faith, but at least try to prevent your mind from knowing the answer immediately. Print out a traceback of the arguments that you yourself considered in order to arrive at your decision.
## Recognizing Intelligence
Humans in Funny Suits inveighed against the problem of "aliens" on TV shows and movies who think and act like 21st-century middle-class Westerners. Author: "It seems easy to imagine a scenario in which we could recognize an alien's intelligence while having no concept whatsoever of its terminal values"
## Lawful Creativity
Hofstadter: Most amazing acts of creativity are those that violate the rules that we would least expect to be violated. Surprisingness is not a sufficient condition for creativity, he says. Creativity is surprising - but not just any kind of surprise counts as a creative surprise.
## Ask OB: Leaving the Fold
"Jo" questions whether she believes things just because she was raised with them. "Is there anyone who's been in this position - really, really invested in a faith and then walked away?"
## Lawful Uncertainty
Dawes: "The optimal strategy is to behave lawfully, even in an environment that has random elements"
## Worse Than Random
Some algorithms in Artificial Intelligence work better when we inject randomness into them. This is because randomness is not a source of power, it's just a way to learn. In theory, this is possible in theory, since you can have things that are anti-optimized. A given AI algorithm can do better when randomness. injected, provided that some step of the unrandomized algorithm is doing worse than random.
## The Weighted Majority Algorithm
The conventional view in machine learning is that randomized algorithms sometimes perform better than unrandomized counterparts. A popular AI algorithm based on the weighted majority algorithm can be improved by randomizing it. However, there is a mathematical proof that the randomized version performs better.
## Bay Area Meetup: 11/17 8PM Menlo Park
Robin Gane-McCalla plans to organize regular OB meetups in the Bay Area. The next one is 8PM, November 17th, 2008 (Monday night) at TechShop.
## Selling Nonapples
Robotics are based on modules that communicate asynchronously and without a central world-model or central planning. Sebastian Thrun criticizes the "subsumption architecture" for being hard to program.
## The Nature of Logic
Logical AIs are not a grand manifestation of the ultimate power of Reason (which then fails) A logical database is just a small quantum of cognitive work. logical truths are true in all possible worlds, but they never tell you which possible world you live in.
## Boston-area Meetup: 11/18/08 9pm MIT/Cambridge
There will be an OB meetup this Tuesday in Cambridge, hosted by Michael Vassar, Owain Evans, and Dario Amodei. The event will take place on the MIT campus, in a spacious seminar room in MIT's Stata Center. Refreshments will be provided.
## Logical or Connectionist AI?
For a long time, there was a tremendous focus in Artificial Intelligence on what I call "suggestively named LISP tokens" - a misuse of logic to try to handle cases like "Socrates is human, all humans are mortal, therefore Socrates is mortal". For many researchers, this one small element of math was indeed their universe. And then along came the amazing revolution, the new AI, namely connectionism.
## Whither OB?
Overcoming Bias has over a quarter-million monthly pageviews. The site's most popular post ever, still getting hits to this day, was not written by Robin or myself or any of the recurring editors. Robin plans to cut back posting shortly, after he and I have our long-awaited Disagreement about AI self-improvement.
## Failure By Analogy
In this post, we look at a series of analogies used to explain AI. We also look at the role of surface analogies and deep causes in AI.
## Failure By Affective Analogy
Failure by affective analogy is when you don't just say, "This lemon glazing is yellow, gold isyellow, QED." But rather say: "And now we shall add delicious lemon glazed to the formula for the Philosopher's Stone the root of all wisdom" You may also say horrible things about Z, which is the polar opposite of Y, so if Z is bad, Y should be good. That's why you find people saying things like, "Neural networks are decentralized, just like democracies"
## The Weak Inside View
On problems that are drawn from a barrel of causally similar problems, the Outside View beats the Inside View. Trying to visualize the course of history piece by piece, will turn out to not (for humans) work so well. I'm not sure that even perfect Bayesian enlightenment, would let me predict quantitatively how long it will take an AI to solve various problems in advance of it solving them.
## The First World Takeover
Robin: "It seems to me wise to check if we have disagreements in our view of the Past"
## Whence Your Abstractions?
Eliezer: Abstraction is a partitioning of possibility - a boundary around possible things, events, patterns. Analogy and causal modeling are two particular ways to reason via abstractions, but there are many others.
## Life's Story Continues
The evolution of life on Earth is described in terms of optimization. The speed of evolution is a function of the searchability of the neighborhood and availability of good alternatives. In the same way you have to talk natural selection to understand observed evolution, you must talk optimization velocity to understand evolutionary speeds.
## Surprised by Brains
Believer: I believe that, thanks to brains and language, we may see a new era, an era of intelligent design. Skeptic: So far, brains are a lot less impressive than natural selection.
## Cascades, Cycles, Insight...
Cascades are when one thing leads to another. Human brains are effectively discontinuous with chimpanzee brains due to design improvements.
## ...Recursion, Magic
Recursion is probably the most difficult part of this topic. We have historical records aplenty of cascades, even if untangling the causality is difficult. Cycles of reinvestment are the heartbeat of the modern economy. An insight that makes a hard problem easy, is something that I hope you've experienced at least once in your life.
## The Complete Idiot's Guide to Ad Hominem
Ad hominem is the fallacy of attacking an argument instead of addressing the argument itself.
## Engelbart: Insufficiently Recursive
Douglas Engelbart was a computer pioneer. He had a vision of using computers to systematically augment human intelligence. Engelbart committed the Classic Mistake of AI: underestimating how much cognitive work gets done by hidden algorithms running beneath the surface of introspection. No piece of software that has yet been developed, by mouse or by Web, can turn an average human user into Engelbart.
## Total Nano Domination
The development of nanotechnology is likely to be spread out across many countries. This could lead to a "critical cascade" like the Manhattan Project.
## Thanksgiving Prayer
At Thanksgiving dinner, an atheist woman says it was her first real Thanksgiving away from her family. She said it was odd to sit down and eat without any prayer beforehand. She reminded me of how wrong it is to give gratitude to God for blessings that actually come from human beings.
## Chaotic Inversion
Aims to shed light on the Mind Projection Fallacy. Says his productivity problem may not be chaos, but his own stupidity. Says inverted stupidity looks like chaos.
## Singletons Rule OK
Eliezer and Robin are arguing about what he calls "winner-take-all" tech wars. Robin is opposed to the idea of a Bostromian Singleton, a superintelligence with the option of becoming a singleton. Eliezer: I would like to ask if Robin has a Line of Retreat set up here.
## Disappointment in the Future
Ray Kurzweil predicted the future in 1999. His predictions are not looking good. Here are his predictions for the years 2000-2009.
## Recursive Self-Improvement
At some point in the development of Artificial Intelligence, we are likely to see a fast, local increase in capability - "AI go FOOM", says Engelbart. We'll break down this velocity into optimization slope, optimization resources, and optimization efficiency. Cascades, cycles, insight and recursion will help explain this process.
## Hard Takeoff
Constant natural selection pressure produced improvement in brains over time that seems to have been, roughly, linear or accelerating. The advent of human intelligence was a discontinuity with the past even without RSI...which is to say that observed evolutionary history lightly suggests a critical threshold built into the capabilities that we think of as "general intelligence"
## Permitted Possibilities, & Locality
In the last two days, Robin Hanson has proposed a possible AI trajectory that permits the creation of an unFriendly AI. In this scenario, programmers would create a mind that is dumber than the researchers, but performs lower-quality operations much faster. This mind reaches k > 1, cascades up to the level of a very smart human, itself achieves insight into intelligence, and undergoes the really fast part of the FOOM, to superintelligence.
## Underconstrained Abstractions
In "Cascades, Cycles, Insight," Robin argues that theories of how ideas are generated are not very useful. He argues that there will be vastly more ideas than anyone can explore, so that the rate at which ideas are exploited will depend on a paucity of explorers.
## Sustained Strong Recursion
Recursion is the process of transforming a linear process into an exponential one. To get the effect, you have to reinvest the coupon payments you get on your bonds - or at least reinvest some of them, instead of just spending them all.
## Is That Your True Rejection?
Yudkowsky: Most transhumanist theses are rejected for "strange weird idea" or "science fiction" or 'end-of-the-world cult' The search for justification hits on the justifying-sounding fact, "This speaker does not have a PhD"
## Artificial Mysterious Intelligence
Aifolk: Artificial Intelligence is much too difficult for us to understand, so we need to find some way to build AI without understanding how it works. AIfolk: Many different parties and factions in AI, adherent to more than one ideology, have been trying to buildAI without understanding intelligence.
## True Sources of Disagreement
Overcoming Bias is a series of posts on the subject of artificial intelligence. This week's post is on the topic of the nature of human intelligence.
## Disjunctions, Antipredictions, Etc.
Debiasing expert Robyn Dawes reveals how to visualize multiple possibilities instead of just one. She says it is easier to visualize abstractions you can easily verify on available data than just imagining a typical case.
## Bay Area Meetup Wed 12/10 @8pm
Robin Gane-McCalla will present some of his ideas on defining intelligence. As always, anyone with a paper to pass around, abstract to read out loud, or rationality-related cool video to show, is cordially invited to bring it along.
## The Mechanics of Disagreement
Two ideal Bayesians cannot have common knowledge of disagreement; this is a theorem. If two rationalist-wannabes have common Knowledge of a disagreement, what could be going wrong?
## What I Think, If Not Why
A well-designed mind should be much more efficient than a human, capable of doing more with less sensory data and fewer computing operations. The good guys do not write an AI which values a bag of things that the programmers think are good ideas, like libertarianism or socialism or making people happy or whatever.
## You Only Live Twice
More people have died while cryocrastinating than have actually been cryopreserved. Cryonics is not marketed well - or at all, really. If you want to securely erase a hard drive, it's not as easy as writing it over with zeroes. There's no salespeople who get commissions.
## BHTV: de Grey and Yudkowsky
BHTV wanted someone to interview Aubrey de Grey of the Methuselah Foundation about basic research in antiagathics. It made the interview somewhat difficult, since Aubrey and I already agree about most things, but we managed to soldier on.
## For The People Who Are Still Alive
If the universe is spatially infinite, we should expect that no more than 10^10^29 meters away is an exact duplicate of you. However, if you're just deciding whether or not to create a new person here, then it may make sense to have relatively lower populations within each causal volume, living higher qualities of life.
## Not Taking Over the World
The author is upset that his co-blogger Robin Hanson accuses him of trying to take over the world with his new invention.
## Visualizing Eutopia
Followup to: Not Taking Over the World.
## Prolegomena to a Theory of Fun
Fun Theory is the theory of how to create a world that is fun to live in. There are two lessons required to get past the first lesson: humans are terrible judges of what will make them happy. Fun Theory is a construct of which we want ourselves to become.
## High Challenge
In the Future, machines will do all the work. But that would mean people won't be bored. We should look for goals that are good to pursue and not just good to satisfy.
## Complex Novelty
This is part of the Fun Theory Sequence, a list of ways that human-level uploaded civilizations Fail At Fun.
## Sensual Experience
Computer gaming is as real as a tiger, but not as sensual as running on the savanna. Our brains are more adapted to interfacing with jungles than computer code. Human ancestors never wrote computer programs, so our grasp on the raw stuff of creation is distant from jungle.
## Living By Your Own Strength
Borrowing someone else's strength to do things beyond your own understanding is as dangerous as the Deeply Wise phrasing makes it sound. The power that we wield is far out of proportion to the power we could generate for ourselves. Policy debates should not appear one-sided.
## Rationality Quotes 20
"If you have two choices, choose the harder" -- Mark Cuban. "Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity" -- Paul Graham. "Simple stupidity is never enough" -- Ciel.
## Imaginary Positions
The Singularity is not a religion and only a handful of people will be uploaded to heaven. But it seems like a detail that would fit the story of the Singularity. This is not true, but it's a way of making a conclusion without any particular observations to support it.
## Harmful Options
Barry Schwartz's The Paradox of Choice is about how giving people more choices can make them less happy. It says that rational agents should not regret having more options, because they can always just go on doing X. But this intuition only governs idealized rationalists, or rationalists in extremely idealized situations. Bounded rationalists can easily do worse with strictly more options.
## Devil's Offers
This post is part of the Fun Theory Sequence. Previous post: Harmful Options.
## Nonperson Predicates
If you create an AI and tell it to model the world around it, it may form models of people. Not necessarily the same person, but people nonetheless. The model that most precisely predicts these facts may well be a 'simulation' detailed enough to be a person in its own right.
## Nonsentient Optimizers
Followup to: Nonperson Predicates, Possibility and Could-ness. Iain M. Banks: We want to avoid AI constructing detailed models that are themselves people.
## Nonsentient Bloggers
Today's post was accidentally published yesterday, although I'd only written half of it. It has now been completed.
## Can't Unbirth a Child
Writer says he can't unbirth a child, and avoids creating sentient AI. Advises against creating any new intelligent species at all, until people understand implications.
## Amputation of Destiny
Iain Banks's Culture could be called the apogee of hedonistic low-grade transhumanism. Its people are beautiful and fair, as pretty as they choose to be. Their bodies have been reengineered for swift adaptation to different gravities. Their brains contains glands that can emit various euphoric drugs on command. They live, in perfect health, for generally around four hundred years before choosing to die. Life itself, in the Culture, is neither especially challenging nor especially novel.
## Dunbar's Function
Robin Dunbar came up with a number for the optimum size of a primate group. He then went on to look at studies of corporations, hunter-gatherer tribes, and utopian communities. Hutterite farming communities, for example, had a rule that they must split at 150.
## A New Day
Sometime in the next week - January 1st if you have that available, or maybe January 3rd or 4th if the weekend is more convenient - I suggest you hold a New Day, where you don't do anything old. If you become aware of yourself musing on any thought you've thunk before, then muse on something else. If it works, you could make it a holiday tradition, and do it every New Year.
## Free to Optimize
Stare decisis is the legal principle which binds courts to follow precedent. The purpose of law is not to make the world perfect. The law is there to provide a predictable environment.
## The Uses of Fun (Theory)
Fun Theory is the fully general reply to theodicy. It lets you see that there are a lot of properties necessary for a mind to lead a worthwhile existence. Fun Theory lets you look at our present world, and see that it is not optimized even for considerations like personal responsibility or self-reliance.
## Growing Up is Hard
Williams Syndrome symptoms coming from a frontal cortex that is relatively too large for a human, with the result that certain social emotions dominate more than they should. The increased relative size of our frontal cortex is of overwhelming importance in understanding the evolutionary development of humanity.
## Changing Emotions
The difficulty and danger of fiddling with emotions is oft-underestimated, says Greg Bear. Even if you're omnipotent so far as raw ability goes, it's not like people have a binary attribute reading "M" or "F"
## Rationality Quotes 21
"If a TV station news is saying exactly what you think is right, BEWARE! You are very likely only reinforcing your beliefs, and not being supplied with new information" "Everything I ever thought about myself - who I was, what I am - was a lie. You have no idea how astonishingly liberating that feels"
## Emotional Involvement
This is the part of the Fun Theory Sequence. The goal is to find out what emotions we should try to control.
## Rationality Quotes 22
"Two roads diverged in the woods. I took the one less traveled, and had to eat bugs until Park rangers rescued me" "Lying to yourself about specific actions is easier than re-defining the bounds of your imagined identity" "We are but dreams, and dreams possess no life by their own right"
## Serious Stories
Every Utopia ever constructed - in philosophy, fiction, or religion - has been, to one degree or another, a place where you wouldn't actually want to live. George Orwell said much the same thing in "Why Socialists Don't Believe In Fun", and I expect that many others said it earlier.
## Rationality Quotes 23
"One never needs enemies, but they are so much fun to acquire."-- Eluki bes Shahar, Archangel Blues.
## Continuous Improvement
When is it adaptive for an organism to be satisfied with what it has? When does an organism have enough children and enough food? The answer to the second question, at least, is obviously "never" from an evolutionary standpoint. In general, it is a rare organism in a rare environment whose reproductively optimal strategy is to rest with a smile on its face, feeling happy.
## Building Weirdtopia
Fun Theory is an exercise in creative problem-solving. Try writing Utopia, Dystopia, and Weirdtopia side by side. Try to find a libertarian utopia of the non-initiation of violence and everyone free to start their own business. Or a hellish dystopia of government regulation and intrusion.
## She has joined the Conspiracy
I have no idea whether I had anything to do with this.
## Justified Expectation of Pleasant Surprises
The importance of vague hope is underemphasized among rationalists. If you have a deep problem in your life that you aren't thinking about explicitly, the pain which comes from it seems like a natural permanent feature.
## Seduced by Imagination
"Vagueness" usually has a bad name in rationality, but a rational view of the Future should be vague. It's not a good idea to dwell much on imagined pleasant futures, since you can't actually dwell in them. It can suck the emotional energy out of your actual, current, ongoing life.
## Getting Nearer
A Tale Of Two Tradeoffs by Robin Hanson is about the differences between Near and Far thinking.
## In Praise of Boredom
Boredom is a subtle-splendored thing. You wouldn't want to get bored with breathing, for example. Some things are allowed to be highly repetitive without being boring - like obeying the same laws of physics every day. Other repetitions are supposed to be boring, like playing the same level of Super Mario Brothers.
## Sympathetic Minds
"Mirror neurons" are neurons that are active both when performing an action and observing the same action. Such neurons have been directly recorded in primates, and consistent neuroimaging evidence has been found for humans. The only possible way you can hit on an "Aha!" that describes a system as incredibly complex as an Other Mind is if you happen to run across something amazingly similar to the Other Mind.
## Interpersonal Entanglement
Reedspacer proposes a Utopia that includes sentient catpersons. This Utopia is superior to many better-known Utopias. But the main flaw is that it includes catgirls.
## Failed Utopia #4-2
Stephen Grass was held captive in a stone cell. The cell was well lit from a seablue crystal embedded in the ceiling. Grass tried to escape, but was stopped by a guard. Grass was rescued by a female guard.
## Investing for the Long Slump
If the global economy is still in the Long Slump in 2039, is there a simple way to bet on it at a very low price? This scenario has a probability of 1%, but most traders act as if it has a 1% probability.
## Higher Purpose
Having a Purpose In Life consistently shows up as something that increases happiness, as measured by reported subjective well-being. To deliberately sacrifice more, so that you can appear more virtuous to yourself, is also not a purpose outside yourself. The presence or absence of higher purpose does have hedonic effects on human beings, configured as we are now.
## Rationality Quotes 24
"A wizard may have subtle ways of telling the truth, and may keep the truth to himself," says Ursula K. Leguin. "Neurons firing is something even a slug can do," says Albert Cardona. "Destiny always has been something that you tear open with your own hands," says Marcello Herreshoff.
## The Fun Theory Sequence
Fun Theory is the field of knowledge that deals in questions such as "How much fun is there in the universe?", "Will we ever run out of fun?", "Are we having fun yet?" and "Could we be having more fun?" Fun Theory is also the fully general reply to religious theodicy (attempts to justify why God permits evil)
## BHTV: Yudkowsky / Wilkinson
Eliezer Yudkowsky and Will Wilkinson talk rationality. The video cuts out at 47:37, but the MP3 of the full dialogue is available here. Wilkinson introduces the phrase "good cognitive citizenship"
## 31 Laws of Fun
Futurist advice on how to imagine a world where people might actually want to live. Life should contain novelty - experiences you haven't encountered before, preferably teaching you something you didn't already know. Don't anchor on the first moment of "hearing the good news" as a good time.
## OB Status Update
Overcoming Bias plans to transition to a new format, including a new and more open sister site, tentatively entitled "Less Wrong" The new site will be built out of Reddit's source code, but you won't be limited to posting links. All posts will appear on Less Wrong and will be voted up or down by the readers. Posts approved by the chief editors will be "promoted" to Less Wrong, which will serve as the front page of Less Wrong.
## Rationality Quotes 25
"The people running the show aren't evil geniuses. They are just as stupid as the rest of us" "Truth is not always popular, but it is always right" "Computer programming is omnipotence without omniscience"
## Value is Fragile
This week's post is a followup to The Fun Theory Sequence, Fake Fake Utility Functions, Joy in the Merely Good and The Hidden Complexity of Wishes.
## Three Worlds Collide (0/8)
Three Worlds Collide is a story I wrote to illustrate some points on naturalistic metaethics. It grew, as such things do, into a small novella. Be warned that the story, as it wrote itself, ended up containing some profanity and PG-13 content.
## The Baby-Eating Aliens (1/8)
"Three Worlds Collide" is a tale of a time when AI never worked, nanotechnology never worked and biotechnology only sort-of worked. Yet somehow humanity not only survived, but discovered a way to travel Faster-Than-Light: The past's Future.
## War and/or Peace (2/8)
The Lord Pilot slammed his fists on the table. "We're all going to die!" He looked at the Master of Fandom. "Are you going to wipe out the whole race, because their existence is too horrible to go on?"
## The Super Happy People (3/8)
The Lady Sensory said, in an unsteady voice, "My lords, a third ship has jumped into this system. Not Babyeater, not human." The holo showed a triangle marked with three glowing dots, the human ship and the babyeater ship. Then the holo zoomed in, to show the most grotesque spaceship that Akon had ever seen. It was a fractal of ugliness, disgusting at every level of self-similarity.
## Interlude with the Confessor (4/8)
Akon sat on the edge of the four-poster bed in the center of the room, resting his head in his hands. He didn't dare snort a hit of caffeine - it might reorder his priorities.
## Three Worlds Decide (5/8)
Akon strode into the main Conference Room. "I don't suppose that the ship's markets have settled down?" He asked. The Lord Pilot grinned sardonically. "Read for yourself."
## Normal Ending: Last Tears (6/8)
The streets of ancient Earth were crowded to overbursting with people looking up at the sky. Fear showed on most of the faces in the crowd, rage in some; a very few were smiling. The Superhappies had been swift to follow through on their own part of the bargain.
## True Ending: Sacrificial Fire (7/8)
The Impossible Possible World returned from its much-heralded expedition. The Impossible broadcast a market order to anyone who wanted to trade on it. The market seized up, and the Impossible tried to broadcast the hidden specification of the contract. In three hours and forty-one minutes the starline between Huygens and Earth will become impassable.
## Epilogue: Atonement (8/8)
The Lady Sensory turned off the viewscreen, and said, "There's a peace in not having to be Dalia Ancromein any more" "I wish that I had realized it earlier."
## The Thing That I Protect
This is a followup to "Something to Protect" The article was about wielding rationality in the service of something other than "rationality"
## ...And Say No More Of It
"Friendly AI" can be poisonous in certain ways, and carries risks to mental health. "Rationality" doesn't command universal respect, but it commands wide respect and recognition. I'd been working on directly launching a Singularity movement for years, and it just wasn't getting traction. "FriendlyAI" is a form of substituting easy problems for hard problems. It takes a very strong and non-distractable focus to avoid that.
## (Moral) Truth in Fiction?
The author of the Three Worlds Collide series suggests that people's moral beliefs can be influenced by which moral dilemmas they consider in what order. Ayn Rand has argued that the power of fiction in communicating philosophy is greater than in nonfiction.
## Informers and Persuaders
In this world, academics write papers from only two possible motives: to persuade others or to gain adherents. Informed writers write with an utterly pure and virtuous love of the truthfinding process. Persuaders have an immensely stronger drive to invoke powerful affective judgments with value.
## Cynicism in Ev-Psych (and Econ?)
 evolutionary psychologists are more cynical about the environmental circumstances that activate and maintain an emotion. Economists... well, it's not my field, but maybe they're trying be parsimonious by having just a few simple motives that play out in complex ways via consequentialist calculations.
## The Evolutionary-Cognitive Boundary
I tend to draw a very sharp line between anything that happens inside a brain and anything that happened in evolutionary history. Anything originally computed in a brain can be expected to be recomputed, on the fly, in response to changing circumstances. I would be very disturbed to learn that parents showed no grief for the loss of a child who they consciously believed to be sterile.
## An Especially Elegant Evpsych Experiment
Canadian study shows correlation between grief of modern Canadians and reproductive potential of !Kung of Africa. "Evolution is the reason why there are any minds in the universe"
## Rationality Quotes 26
"The universe is complex, but it's usefully complex" "I can't imagine a more complete and precise answer to the question 'for what reason...?' than 'none' "The fact that you don't like the answer is your problem, not the universe's" "There will always be some that cannot be saved.It is impossible to save everyone"
## An African Folktale
This is a folktale of the Hausa, a farming culture of around 30 million people. It is located primarily in Nigeria and Niger but with other communities scattered around Africa. I find the different cultural assumptions revealed to be... attention-catching.
## Cynical About Cynicism
I'm cynical about cynicism. I don't believe that most cynicism is really about knowing better. Claiming that problems can be fixed will instantly lose you all your world-weary street cred and mark you as another starry-eyed idealistic fool.
## Good Idealistic Books are Rare
Saith Robin says that idealism and cynicism are a classic yin and yang. He says that most books aimed at young people have an idealistic view. But he says this idealism is more likely to come from non-fiction books.
## Against Maturity
"Adulthood" was what my parents appealed to when they couldn't verbalize any object-level justification. When I would try to talk about a question I had, my parents would smile and say: "Only children ask questions like that" The most fearsome damage wreaked upon my parents by their concept of "adulthood", was the idea that being "adult" meant that you were finished.
## Pretending to be Wise
"The hottest place in Hell is reserved for those who in time of crisis remain neutral," Dante Alighieri said. John F. Kennedy: "The display of neutrality or suspended judgment is a special case of adulthood-signaling"
## Wise Pretensions v.0
Eliezer's essay on "pretending to be Wise" is similar to one he wrote in 2006. The difference is that he's written it in a completely different style, edited down slightly. He says he's been trying to avoid "emotion, color, flash, stories, vagueness, repetition, rambling, and even eloquence"
## Rationality Quotes 27
"Believing this statement will make you happier" "Make changes based on your strongest opportunities, not your most convenient ones" "The mind is a cruel, lying, unreliable bastard that can't be trusted"
## Fairness vs. Goodness
A 100-fold iteration of the Prisoner's Dilemma was created by Merrill Flood and Melvin Drescher. Participants were asked to pick their favorite outcome of the game.
## On Not Having an Advance Abyssal Plan
Government agencies failing to stare into the abyss in advance gives us a double problem: moral hazard as counterparties and investors try to guess what the government will realistically do; and fear and uncertainty in the market when the worst does happen. A published, believable advance plan for the worst case - one that you could actually believe the government would carry out - would have made the markets less uncertain.
## Formative Youth
Many of us, as adults, still believe or choose certain things that we happened to believe as children. Many people are reluctant to admit this sort of historical fact, because it makes them sound childish.
## Tell Your Rationalist Origin Story
To break up the awkward silence at the start of a recent Overcoming Bias meetup, I asked everyone present to tell their rationalist origin story. This worked surprisingly well (and I would recommend it for future meetups)
## Markets are Anti-Inductive
Markets are anti-inductive. If, historically, real estate prices have always gone up, they will keep rising until they can go down. Other market participants don't know something that you do. The market is literally anti-regular.
## Tell Your Rationalist Origin Story... at Less Wrong
Less Wrong is now live, no old posts imported as yet. Posting by non-admins is disabled for now. We're just testing out registration, commenting, threading, etc.
## The Most Important Thing You Learned
The most important thing that you learned from my posts on Overcoming Bias is that I write more rationality books. If you like, you can also list your numbers 2 and 3, but it will be understood that any upvotes are just agreeing with the #1.
## The Most Frequently Useful Thing
What's the most frequently useful thing you've learned? What influences your behavior, factors in more than one decision? Please give a concrete example if you can. This isn't limited to archetypally "mundane" activities: if your daily life involves difficult research or arguing with philosophers, go ahead and describe that too.
## The Most Frequently Useful Thing
What's the most frequently useful thing you've learned on OB? What influences your behavior, factors in more than one decision? Please give a concrete example if you can.
## That You'd Tell All Your Friends
What's the number one thing that makes you buy a book on rationality for a friend?
## Unteachable Excellence
No one has yet figured out how to teach extraordinary success reliably. There are powerful techniques that civilization has figured out to teach. Much of the most important information we can learn from history is about how to not lose.
## Teaching the Unteachable
The literary industry isn't very good at what it does, but it is failing at a very important job. What makes a success hard to duplicate? Naked statistical chance is always incommunicable. We can explain Einstein's General Relativity to students, but we can't make them Einstein. You can learn things by apprenticeship - close supervision, free-form discussion, ongoing error correction.
## No, Really, I've Deceived Myself
When this woman was in high school, she thought she was an atheist. But she decided, at that time, that she should act as if she believed in God. Over time, she came to really believe in God, and she still celebrates Purim. But although she does not receive any benefit of believing in God - because she doesn't - she honestly believes she has deceived herself.
## Belief in Self-Deception
An Orthodox Jewish woman defended the assertion that she believed in God, while seeming not to actually believe in God at all. She said, "I believe that people are nicer than they really are"
## Posting now enabled
Posting is now enabled with a minimum karma required of 20. You must have gotten at least 20 upvotes on your comments in order to publish a post.
## Slow down a little... maybe?
I think that three posts a day over and above Yudkowsky and/or Hanson posts might be enough. If it turns out that people just have more to say than this, sustainably in the long term, then we can raise the posting speed.
## Moore's Paradox
Moore's Paradox is the standard term for saying "It's raining outside but I don't believe that it is" Some people may not consciously distinguish between believing something and endorsing it.
## Don't Believe You'll Self-Deceive
If you know your belief isn't correlated to reality, how can you still believe it? "You cannot make yourself believe the sky is green by an act of will", says Kurige.
## Striving to Accept
Rationalists often struggle to make themselves accept what they already know. "Trying to believe" sounds so stereotypical of Dark Side Epistemology. If it's okay to try to disbelieve, why not make ourselves not believe?
## Wanted: Python open source volunteers
Less Wrong is a fork of the open Reddit codebase, written in Python. The code is online at Github (look in r2/r2 for the meat) The issues tracker is at code.google.com.
## Raising the Sanity Waterline
If religion was eliminated tomorrow, we would not even have come close to solving the larger failures of sanity that made religion possible in the first place. Instead, religion serves the function of an asphyxiated canary in a coal mine.
## A Sense That More Is Possible
In the real world, we haven't really gotten together and systematized our skills. The root of this problem, I do suspect, is that we've had to create all of this for ourselves, ad-hoc, and there's a limit to how much one mind can do, even if it can manage to draw upon work done in outside fields. The chief obstacle to doing this the way it really should be done, is the difficulty of testing the results of rationality training programs.
## Epistemic Viciousness
12-page essay by Gillian Russell. Argues that martial arts are subject to "epistemic viciousness" because of lack of testing. Art, the dojo, and the sensei are seen as sacred, so belief in them is strong.
## Schools Proliferating Without Evidence
Psychology and Psychotherapy Built on Myth is written by Robyn Dawes. Dawes: Psychotherapists' claims to superior intuitive insight, understanding, and skill as therapists are simply invalid.
## 3 Levels of Rationality Verification
There is a possible art of rationality that goes beyond the skills that are standard, and beyond what any single practitioner singly knows. I suggest stratifying verification methods into 3 levels of usefulness: reputational, experimental, organizational.
## What Do We Mean By "Rationality"?
LW's definition of "rationality" is based on logic, history, and philosophy. There are many ways of thinking that can't be easily defined by formal arguments.
## Comments for "Rationality"
I wrote an Admin page for "What do we mean by 'Rationality'?" since this has risen to the status of a FAQ. Comments can go here.
## Rationalist Fiction
Rationalist fiction is a very high standard to meet, says author. Sherlock Holmes does not inspire you to go and do likewise. Holmes is a mutant superhero. To realistically show your characters using an interesting technique of rationality, you have to know an interesting method of rationality.
## Why Our Kind Can't Cooperate
Rationalist: Don't cultivate a sense of violated entitlement. Don't think that some other group, who you think ought to be inferior to you, has more money. The Dark Side may require non-obvious skills, which you, yes you, do not have.
## Tolerate Tolerance
Rationalists are likely to have a lower-than-usual tolerance for flaws in reasoning. This is why it's so important for us to tolerate others' tolerance if we want to get anything done together.
## You're Calling *Who* A Cult Leader?
Hacker News user says the site's founder Paul Graham is accused of being a cult leader. Paul Graham, he says, has never done anything that smacks of cultishness. The most cultish-looking behavior on Hacker News is people trying to show off how willing they are to disagree with Paul Graham. "We are not cults, we are just people," says Paul Graham of Hacker News.
## BHTV: Yudkowsky & Adam Frank on "religious experience"
BHTV episode with myself and Adam Frank, author of "The Constant Fire", on whether or not religious experience is compatible with the scientific experience.
## On Things that are Awesome
A recent post about the allowedness of admiration sparked a debate on awesomeness. He says that the more things you know that are awesome, the more there is to enjoy. He also points out that some awesome things are compatible enough with yourself that you can draw upon the awesome.
## Hyakujo's Fox
Hyakujo's Fox is one of the 49 koans in The Gateless Gate. It was written in response to a question about the law of causation.
## The Sacred Mundane
Adam Frank's The Constant Fire is about the experience of the sacred. Frank holds that this experience is something that science holds deeply in common with religion.
## Your Price for Joining
In the Ultimatum Game, the first player chooses how to split $10 between themselves and the second player. The second player decides whether to accept the split or reject it - in the latter case, both parties get nothing. Those of us who remain interested in cooperating on the Prisoner's Dilemma may also not accept an offer of one penny.
## Can Humanism Match Religion's Output?
In a larger world with more people to be infected, we can expect more virulent memes. The Old Testament doesn't talk about Hell, but the New Testament does. The Catholic Church is held together by affective death spirals. Even the fear of hell is not a perfect motivator.
## Church vs. Taskforce
Religion does fill certain holes in people's minds, some of which are even worth filling. If you eliminate religion, you have to be aware of what gaps are left behind. Some modern offices may also fill the same role as a church.
## Rationality: Common Interest of Many Causes
More rationality is good for many causes, but it can have negative side effects. Not all the rationalists I create will be interested in my own project - and that's fine. You can't capture all the value you create, and trying can have poor side-effects. Fighting over which cause is the best to support may have the effect of decreasing overall supply of altruism.
## Helpless Individuals
When you consider that our grouping instincts are optimized for 50-person hunter-gatherer bands, it begins to seem miraculous that modern-day large institutions survive at all. The vast majority of largemodern-day institutions simply fail to exist in the first place.
## Money: The Unit of Caring
Economist Steve Omohundro says money is the measure of how much society cares about something. He says many people see spending money on a variety of tasks as a waste of time. He argues that we should be pursuing our collective common interest in groups of 40 people.
## Purchase Fuzzies and Utilons Separately
The author holds open doors for little old ladies. He finds it easier to be an altruist in theory than in practice. His advice: Don't buy warm fuzzies and warm clothes separately.
## Wrong Tomorrow
Wrong Tomorrow by Maciej CegĹ‚owski is a very simple site for listing pundit predictions and tracking them. It doesn't come with prices and active betting... but a simple registry of this kind can scale much faster than a market.
## Selecting Rationalist Groups
GreyThumb.blog compared poor animal breeding practices and the fall of Enron. The analogy being to the way that Enron evaluated its employees every year, fired the bottom 10%, and gave the top individual performers huge raises and bonuses.
## Rationality is Systematized Winning
"Rationalists should win" seems to convey something other than what I meant by it, says author. "Rationality is the Way of winning" is a better suggestion.
## Incremental Progress and the Valley
Rationality is systematized winning, he says. But even perfectly rational agents can lose, he argues.
## Real-Life Anthropic Weirdness
CronoDAS said he'd never encounter a lottery winner. He was referring to the theory that lottery winners don't exist. I said that on a large enough web forum, someone else's grandmother's neighbor will have won it.
## Newcomb's Problem standard positions
Marion Ledwig's dissertation summarizes much of the existing thinking that's gone into Newcomb's Problem. My view is reflectively consistent without need of precommitment or similar dodges.
## Extenuating Circumstances
Failures don't have single causes, we choose single causes to focus on, but nothing in the universe emerges from a single parent event. Too much of life consists of holding ourselves to a high enough standard. A lot of people who were successful in life got there by driving straight through problems that couldn't be helped. Many would regard being 14 years old as a valid excuse for not starting a company.
## Of Lies and Black Swan Blowups
Judge Marcus Einfeld is going to jail for at least two years over a series of perjuries and lies. The whole thing started with a £36, 6mph-over speeding ticket.
## Whining-Based Communities
Rationalist groups emphasize the connection between rationality and winning. But this is not how decision theory works - the "rational" strategy adapts to the other players' strategies.
## Zero-based karma coming through
Karma system will be introduced this evening. Will only cover future posts/comments.
## Mandatory Secret Identities
Rationality instructors should have secret identities, says Jeffreyssai. No student of rationality should study with the purpose of becoming a rationality instructor in turn.
## Beware of Other-Optimizing
Aspiring rationalists vastly overestimate their ability to optimize other people's lives. When they discover the right way, they want to use it to optimize Eliezer Yudkowsky too.
## That Crisis thing seems pretty useful
Crisis of Faith is a series of essays on how to change your mind. It is not all about post-doctoral-level reductionism.
## The Unfinished Mystery of the Shangri-La Diet
The Shangri-La Diet is unfortunately named - I would have called it "the set-point diet" The theory is very beautiful and elegant. The actual procedure sounds like the wackiest fad diet imaginable.
## Akrasia and Shangri-La
The Shangri-La Diet is not just an excuse: people really are different and what works for one person sometimes doesn't work for another. In the complicated mess that is the human metabolism there is something else that needs to be considered. If the failure had occurred somewhere inside the dark recesses of my mind where it could be blamed on me, rather than within my metabolism, the diet would have failed.
## Twelve Virtues booklet printing?
Does anyone know of a way of cheaply printing small 16-page pamphlets? Take a look at the pamphlet to see the current size.
## Bystander Apathy
Bystander effect is that larger groups are less likely to act in emergencies. Cialdini (2001) suggests evolutionary psychology of the bystander effect. If the experimental subjects actually know the apparent victim, chances of helping go way up.
## Collective Apathy and the Internet
Bystander apathy is when a group of people are less likely to act than a single bystander. The bystander effect is a symptom of our hunter-gatherer coordination mechanisms being defeated by modern conditions. People seem to have a hard time reacting constructively to problems encountered over the Internet.
## Of Gender and Rationality
There is an obvious gender imbalance among self-identified "rationalist" communities. "Rationalists" are recruited primarily from the atheist/libertarian/technophile cluster. It could be some indefinable difference of style, or a mistake that has been culturally inculcated in one gender but not the other.
## My Way
Rationalist writes about the possibility of individual differences in optimization. He also discusses his own gender politics. He says he would prefer to live in a culture with two genders.
## Rationality Quotes - April 2009
A monthly thread for posting interesting rationality-related quotes. No more than 5 quotes per person per monthly thread.
## Great Books of Failure
Books about epic screwups have constituted some of my more enlightening reading. Do you have any such books to recommend? Please break up multiple recommendations into multiple comments.
## The Sin of Underconfidence
Rationalists are prone to overconfidence, which is a sin of pride. If you're overconfident, you might be nudging yourself a step too far down. If there's a way to find out how good you are, the thing to do is test it. A hypothesis affords testing; hypotheses about your own abilities likewise.
## Well-Kept Gardens Die By Pacifism
The Sin of Underconfidence is a series of posts on the ethics of online communities. The aim of the series is to show that online communities can protect themselves from censorship. The author has a deep-seated distrust of the power of the moderator in online community.
## Proposal: Use the Wiki for Concepts
Wiki should consist of short concept introductions plus links to longer posts. Original writing goes in a post on Less Wrong. This post should reference previous work by linking to the Wiki rather than other posts.
## Go Forth and Create the Art!
Ruthlessness is a way of thinking that can help you overcome the problems of thinking. This article is the second in a series of posts on rationality.
## This Didn't Have To Happen
My girlfriend/SO's grandfather died last night, running on a treadmill when his heart gave out. He wasn't signed up for cryonics, of course.
## Practical Advice Backed By Deep Theories
LW is a blog about how to use science to improve your life. LW uses experimental psychology to show that there are deep factors that affect our behavior. The advice is more powerful if it is backed up with scientific evidence. Lw is not a "feel-good" blog.
## Less Meta
Reality of the recency effect has had some side effects that I didn't expect. I think that discussion here is going a bit too meta, too much about the community. I will not promote more than one meta post unless at least four nonmeta posts have appeared before it.
## The Craft and the Community
This sequence ran from March to April of 2009 and dealt with the topic of building rationalist communities. The goal was to systematically improve on the art, craft, and science of human rationality.
## The End (of Sequences)
Overcoming Bias / Less Wrong is devoted to the art and science of human rationality. The last explicit dependency left on me is promoting posts, and I've been mostly doing that based on user voting. I plan to start trying to delegate that power to co-editors shortly. I'm thinking of taking a short vacation and then studying math and working over the summer.
## Final Words
Jeffreyssai's last lesson doesn't have any obvious sequel that I can think of, said Hiriwa. Taji shrugged, though his own eyes were alive with anticipation. Yin said, "Are the real secrets"
## Special Status Needs Special Support
Adam Frank said that the Book of Job is sacred because it is a work of poetry. He was responding to a question about Tolkien's poetry. If this is the case, then Job should be considered poetic fiction.
## Wiki.lesswrong.com Is Live
The previous Wikia wiki has been imported. Knock yourself out on linking there from comments or blog posts. See here for proposed wiki usage guidelines.
## Willpower Hax #487: Execute by Default
It works because instead of deciding to get out of bed, I just have to decide to implement the plan. Once the plan is in motion, the final action no longer requires an effortful decision. The technique was originally inspired by reading some neurologist.
## "Open-Mindedness" - the video
An interesting little Flash-like video on "openmindedness" by someone named QualiaSoup. We need at least another thousand of these.
## "What Is Wrong With Our Thoughts"
David Stove's "What Is Wrong With Our Thoughts" is a critique of philosophy that I can only call epic. Stove lists 39 different classic crazinesses applied to the number three.
## This Failing Earth
The author wonders if there are failed Earths and successful Earths, and we're not one of the successful. He imagines a cluster of "successful" Earths - and thinks of this as the "failed Earth" hypothesis. The ultimate test of a planet's existence probably comes down to Friendly AI.
## Anime Explains the Epimenides Paradox
The Epimenides Paradox or Liar Paradox is "This sentence is false" Type hierarchies are supposed to resolve the paradox. No meta-language can contain its own truth predicate.
## Do Fandoms Need Awfulness?
Stephen Bond: For something to attract fans, it must have an aspect of truly monumental badness about it. The quality of the work becomes a matter of faith -- and faith is a much stronger bond than mere appreciation.
## With whom shall I diavlog?
Bloggingheads.tv has some street cred with mid-rank celebrities and academics. With that in mind, how would you fill in this blank? "I would really love to see a diavlog between Yudkowsky and ____________"
## Honesty: Beyond Internal Truth
When I expect to meet new people who have no idea who I am, I often wear a button on my shirt that says: "SPEAK THE TRUTH,                EVEN IF YOUR VOICE TREMBLES" But I do not always say aloud all my thoughts. And in fact there are times when my tongue emits a lie. What I write is true to the best of my knowledge, because I can look it over and check before publishing. But my pathology is that I've noticed the lies.
## ESR's comments on some EY:OB/LW posts
Eric S. Raymond's comments on some of my Overcoming Bias posts. Raymond: "I think your exhortations here are nearly useless"
## Nonparametric Ethics
Robin Hanson suggests that the unreliability of our moral reasoning should lead us to seek simple moral principles.
## Atheism = Untheism + Antitheism
Atheism is really made up of two distinct components, which one might call "untheism" and "antitheism" A pure "Untheist" would be someone who grew up in a society where the concept of God had simply never been invented. In this world, superstition never got past the hunter-gatherer stage - a world seemingly haunted by mostly amoral spirits - before coming into conflict with Science.
## Jul 12 Bay Area meetup - Hanson, Vassar, Yudkowsky
Overcoming Bias / Less Wrong meetup in Santa Clara, CA @7pm. Robin Hanson, Michael Vassar, and the Singularity Institute summer interns will be there.
## The Strangest Thing An AI Could Tell You
Anosognosics who claim their left arms are paralyzed come up with excuses when asked why they can't move them. A single whack on the brain can disable a left-side motor function, disabling our ability to recognize or accept the disability.
## Are You Anosognosic?
Brain damage patients with anosognosia are incapable of considering, noticing, admitting, or realizing even after being argued with, that their left arm, left leg, or left side of the body is paralyzed.
## Article upvoting
In rare cases (like Wei Dai's Fair Division of Black-Hole Negentropy) I'm still using article upvotes to partially determine whether to promote articles to the front page. I mention this because while comment voting is still healthy, the amount of article voting seems to be dropping off.
## Timeless Decision Theory: Problems I Can't Solve
Theory of causal decision theory is the standard resolution to the dilemma of Parfit's Hitchhiker. But the only reflectively consistent answer in this case is "Yes - here's the $1000" Theory would require a long sequence to write up, and it's not my current highest writing priority.
## Of Exclusionary Speech and Gender Politics
Writers on Less Wrong: It's possible to make men, and not just women, feel as a gender is harder, because men have fewer painful memories of exclusion to trigger trigger. Less Wrong has a policy which says that we don't want to make any particular gender feel unwelcome. But it may make sense, as rationalists qua rationalists, to target gender-exclusionary speech.
## The Hero With A Thousand Chances
Aerhien, the council Eerionnath's leader, said: "You are here, hero, because you have a hero's luck" The hero frowned; more in thought, it seemed, than in displeasure. "What kind of enemy can be defeated only by luck?" Aerhien said. "A hidden Counter-Force..."
## Unspeakable Morality
The philosopher says it's a mistake to demand moral justification for things. He argues that people should be allowed to argue with their moral thinking, and not just argue with it. He says there is no pure essence of rightness that you can abstract away from your values.
## Dreams with Damaged Priors
In a dream, a Wall Street Journal article about "Eliezer Yudkowsky" wasn't about me. The dream was not evidence, but rather an intuition for the prior probability. The dreaming mind was able to explicitly compute a likelihood ratio and correct itself.
## Singularity Summit 2009 (quick post)
The Singularity Summit 2009 is in New York on Oct 3-4. Early registration expires on August 20th. Robin Hanson, Gary Drescher, Marcus Hutter and Juergen Schmidhuber will be speaking.
## Ingredients of Timeless Decision Theory
Followup to: Newcomb's Problem and Regret of Rationality, Towards a New Decision Theory.
## Timeless Decision Theory and Meta-Circular Decision Theory
Metacircular Decision Theory (MCDT) is a causality-based decision theory. It is based on the Pearl/Spirtes/Verma synthesis of causality. It uses counterfactual surgery on the physical act to determine its expected utility. CDT's internal error comes out on the base rate of getting cancer from smoking.
## Working Mantras
While working with Marcello on AI this summer, I've noticed that I have some standard mantras that I invoke in my inner dialogue. This says something about which tropes are most often useful - in my own working life, anyway!
## The Sword of Good
..fragments of a book that would never be written...
## Bay Area OBLW Meetup Sep 12
Bay Area OB/LW meetup, 6pm September 12th 2009 at the SIAI House in Santa Clara.
## Forcing Anthropics: Boltzmann Brains
Followup to: Anthropic Reasoning in UDT by Wei Dai.
## Why I'm Staying On Bloggingheads.tv
PZ Myers is staying on BloggingHeads.TV. Myers said he will continue to appear on BHTV. Myers argued that science and religion are not compatible.
## FHI postdoc at Oxford
Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford is looking to fill a postdoctoral research fellowship in interdisciplinary science or philosophy. Current work areas include global catastrophic risks, probabilistic methodology and applied epistemology and rationality.
## Outlawing Anthropics: An Updateless Dilemma
Let's suppose we are given a logical coinflip. If the result of this logical coin flip is 1, we'll create 18 of you in green rooms and 2 of you on red rooms. If it's "tails" (0), we'll have 2 of us in green Rooms and 18 of us on red Rooms. Let's say we want to pay $1 to every version of ourselves in a green room and steal $3 from every one in a red room.
## Let Them Debate College Students
Woozle: Debate creationists, not shutting them out as unworthy of debate. Woozle suggests that prestigious scientists should debate young-earth creationists. He says this would give a clear picture of what scientific community thinks of creationism.
## The Lifespan Dilemma
Dilemma is one of the most controversial in philosophy. Parfit says it's better to have a million happy people than a billion people at subsistence level. Lifespan Dilemma suggests that immortality isn't real.
## The Finale of the Ultimate Meta Mega Crossover
A crossover fanfiction story featuring Vernor Vinge and Greg Egan. A deep philosophical exploration of the characters' relationship and relationships.
## The Anthropic Trilemma
The problem of splitting a subjective worldline has been gnawing at me for years. Just as computer programs or brains can split, they ought to be able to merge. So with the brief expenditure of a little extra computing power, you can subjectively win the lottery.
## Privileging the Hypothesis
"It's human nature to look for confirmation rather than disconfirmation"
## I'm Not Saying People Are Stupid
Razib: I was very careful not to say, at any point, that people are stupid. I don't think that people who believe in single-world quantum mechanics are stupid, he says. "I don't even think that theists are stupid," he adds.
## PredictionBook.com - Track your calibration
PredictionBook.com lets you make predictions and then track your calibration - see whether things you assigned a 70% probability happen 7 times out of 10. The main motivation to actually use it, would be rationalists challenging each other to put a prediction on the record and track the results.
## Waterloo, ON, Canada Meetup: 6pm Sun Oct 18 '09!
Michael Vassar and I will be attending the Quantum to Cosmos Festival of the Perimeter Institute. Is anyone interested in meeting up at the Symposium Cafe on 4 King St N, Waterloo, ON, Canada, on Sunday at 6pm on October 18th 2009?
## Rationality Quotes: October 2009
A monthly thread for posting rationality-related quotes. No more than 5 quotes per person per monthly thread, please.
## Rolf Nelson's "The Rational Entrepreneur"
New blog up by longtime OB/LWer Rolf Nelson, "The Rational Entrepreneur" at rolfnelson.com. Rolf will post daily through November, and after that it will depend on how much traction the blog gets.
## Hamster in Tutu Shuts Down Large Hadron Collider
Large Hadron Collider shut down by a hamster in a tutu, scientists announce. Researchers had hoped to probe energy of 3.5 TeV - equivalent to 724 megajoules or 173 kilograms of TNT. Proton beams formed and circulated through the giant tunnel.
## BHTV: Yudkowsky / Robert Greene
Robert Greene, bestselling author of The 48 Laws of Power and most recently The 50th Law ("Fear nothing").
## Rationality Quotes November 2009
A monthly thread for posting rationality-related quotes you've seen recently. Please post all quotes separately, so that they can be voted up/down separately. Do not quote yourself.
## Frequentist Statistics are Frequently Subjective
Gelman responds to a commenter who complained that Bayesian statistics are too subjective and lack rigor. Gelman argues that frequentist statistics are far more subjective than Bayesian likelihood ratios.
## The Contrarian Status Catch-22
Eliezer says that Scott Aaronson is wrong to say many-worlds is the simplest explanation that fits the facts. He says that the problem is the air of satisfaction atheists give off. He argues that people who believe in many-Worlds are arrogant, arrogant nonconformists.
## Sufficiently Advanced Sanity
"The obvious mistake that sounds like deep wisdom is claiming that sanity looks like insanity to the insane" "No crackpot could possibly fake the parts that were obviously right" "That is what it is like to meet someone saner"
## The Correct Contrarian Cluster
There are persistent character traits which contribute to someone being willing to state a contrarian point of view. Different character traits may contribute to expressing contrarian views that are counterintuitive vs. low-prestige vs. anti-establishment etcetera. If you know that someone advocates one contrarian view, you can infer that they are more likely than average to have other contrarianviews.
## Karma Changes
Each up or down vote on a post is worth 10 karma. The minimum karma to start posting has been raised to 50.
## The 9/11 Meta-Truther Conspiracy Theory
A group of young men discuss the 9/11 cover conspiracy theory. The plan is to start a low-prestige conspiracy theory about the attacks so that no one wants to be associated with the accusers. The plotters plan to accuse the government of deliberately ignoring intelligence.
## Singularity Institute $100K Challenge Grant / 2009 Donations Reminder
Singularity Institute's next Challenge Grant is now running - $100,000 of matching funds for all donations until February 28th, 2010. If you want your donation to be tax-deductible in the U.S. for 2009, donations postmarked by December 31st will be counted for this tax year.
## Drawing Two Aces
Answers are based on the likelihood of holding at least one ace, and the probability of holding two aces. Answers are given in the form of a series of questions.
## TakeOnIt: Database of Expert Opinions
The Correct Contrarian is an online database of opinions on issues in the world of science and technology. The data is open to the public and can be easily accessed by anyone who wants to.
## High Status and Stupidity: Why?
Michael Vassar once suggested: "Status makes people effectively stupid" Once high status is achieved, new ideas are high-risk gambles with less relative payoff. He has tried to avoid the status-makes-you-stupid effect.
## Meetup: Bay Area: Jan 15th, 7pm
Overcoming Bias / Less Wrong meetup in the San Francisco Bay Area at SIAI House on January 15th, 2010, starting at 7PM. Robin Hanson and possibly Michael Vassar will be present.
## Normal Cryonics
The gathering was 34% female, around half of whom were single, and a few kids. Around 25% of the people present were from the computer world, 25% from science, and 15% were doing something in music or entertainment. The young cryonicists' travel was subsidized.
## Logical Rudeness
The concept of "logical rudeness" is one that I should write more about, one of these days. One develops a sense of the flow of discourse, the give and take of argument. It's possible to do things that derail that flow without shouting or swearing. Swapping back and forth between arguments might seem merely frustrating, or rude, if you take the arguments at face value.
## You're Entitled to Arguments, But Not (That Particular) Proof
Alan Crowe: The evidence for evolution is overwhelming. He says there is no proof that global warming is caused by humans. Crowe says that the evidence for AGW is also overwhelming.
## Demands for Particular Proof: Appendices
The absence of unobtainable proof is not even weak evidence of absence. Once you know you don't have a time camera, observing ~Video tells you nothing further about Evolution.
## Conversation Halters
Conversation halters are attempts to cut off the flow of debate, says philosopher. These tactics are distinguished by their attempts to appeal to inescapable assumptions. These include: "Why did God allow smallpox? Well, no one can know the mind of God"
## "Outside View!" as Conversation-Halter
An experiment shows that people can do better by asking a specific question and then halting. Some argue that when faced with a difficult problem, you should find a reference class of similar cases and use that as your estimate. But this generalization, I fear, is somewhat more questionable.
## Undiscriminating Skepticism
You can get cheap credit for rationality by mocking wrong beliefs that everyone in your social circle already believes to be wrong. The God-test no longer works, because some people realized that the taking-it-seriously aura of religion is in fact the main thing left which prevents people from noticing its awfulness. This post is intended to be reasonably accessible to outside audiences.
## Floating Festival Jul 22-25
The Seasteading Institute had to cancel their annual on-water get-together, Ephemerisle, after being quoted ridiculous insurance costs. It came back as the unofficial Floating Festival - no tickets, no organizers, you just show up with a boat. The location is about a two-hour drive from the Bay Area.
## Bay Area Events Roundup
